# Configuration Reference

Fansly Downloader NG reads configuration from a single **`config.yaml`** at
the working directory root. The loader uses [`ruamel.yaml`](https://yaml.readthedocs.io/),
which preserves comments, key order, and anchors across rewrites — your
hand-written YAML structure survives load → modify → dump cycles intact.

CLI flags override config values when both are present (see
[CLI ↔ config mapping](#cli--config-mapping) below).

> **Auto-migration on first load**: a legacy `config.ini` is silently
> migrated to `config.yaml` on first run; the original `.ini` is preserved
> as a backup. Retired keys (`db_sync_*`, `metadata_handling`,
> `separate_metadata`) are silently dropped from the YAML on load.

> **`extra="forbid"` everywhere**: every section enforces strict-key
> validation. A typo in a key name raises a clear `ValidationError` at
> startup rather than being silently ignored. If the loader rejects your
> file, the error message names the unknown key and the section it appeared
> in.

## Quick example

A minimal `config.yaml`:

```yaml
targeted_creator:
  usernames:
    - alice
    - bob

my_account:
  authorization_token: your_session_token_here
  user_agent: "Mozilla/5.0 …"

options:
  download_directory: /mnt/media/Fansly
  download_mode: NORMAL

postgres:
  pg_host: localhost
  pg_port: 5432
  pg_database: fansly_metadata
  pg_user: fansly_user
  pg_password: your_db_password
```

---

## `targeted_creator`

Which creator(s) to download from.

```yaml
targeted_creator:
  usernames:
    - alice
    - bob
  use_following: false
```

| Field           | Type                | Default | Description                                                                                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `usernames`     | `list[str] \| null` | `null`  | Creator usernames to process. A comma-separated string (legacy `config.ini` shape) is auto-coerced into a list at parse time |
| `use_following` | `bool`              | `false` | When `true`, ignore `usernames` and download from every creator the account follows. Equivalent to `-uf` on the CLI          |

### Retired fields (silently dropped on load)

| Field                           | Reason                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `use_following_with_pagination` | CLI-only macro (`-ufp`) — toggles `use_following` AND `options.use_pagination_duplication` together at runtime. Never a real YAML setting; not consulted from there |

## `my_account`

Authentication credentials.

```yaml
my_account:
  authorization_token: your_session_token_here
  user_agent: "Mozilla/5.0 …"
  check_key: qybZy9-fyszis-bybxyf
  username: null
  password: null
```

| Field                 | Type                | Default                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `authorization_token` | `SecretStr`         | `"ReplaceMe"`            | Fansly session token. Stored as `SecretStr` so it never accidentally prints in logs or tracebacks. Read via `.get_secret_value()` in code                                                         |
| `user_agent`          | `str`               | `"ReplaceMe"`            | Browser user-agent string sent on every HTTP request. Must match the user-agent of the browser the `authorization_token` was extracted from, or Fansly's session-binding will reject the requests |
| `check_key`           | `str`               | `"qybZy9-fyszis-bybxyf"` | Fansly's per-deployment request-signing key. Auto-extracted from `main.js` on session setup; the default here is a known-good seed for first-run config generation                                |
| `username`            | `str \| None`       | `null`                   | Account username (optional; used for the password-login flow as an alternative to `authorization_token` extraction)                                                                               |
| `password`            | `SecretStr \| None` | `null`                   | Account password (optional; pairs with `username` for the password-login flow). Stored as `SecretStr`                                                                                             |

### `options` — debugging

There is no YAML toggle for runtime verbosity. Pass `-v` (DEBUG floor on
every handler) or `-vv` (TRACE floor on every handler) on the command
line, or edit `logging.global.default_level` for persistent per-handler
defaults. See [`logging`](#logging) below for the per-handler levels and
the [CLI mapping table](#cli--config-mapping) for the verbosity flags.

### Retired fields (silently dropped on load)

The following keys were valid in earlier versions and are now silently
stripped from the YAML on load. Keeping them in your file is harmless:

- `separate_metadata` — SQLite-era flag; was always a no-op under Postgres
- `metadata_handling` — runtime never branched on `SIMPLE` vs `ADVANCED`
- `db_sync_commits`, `db_sync_seconds`, `db_sync_min_size` — SQLite-era
  write-sync tuning knobs; not consulted under asyncpg
- `debug`, `trace` — replaced by the `-v` / `-vv` CLI flags (per-run
  runtime override). For persistent verbosity, set
  `logging.global.default_level` instead

---

## `filters`

Content filters: per-creator wall selection and media size/duration limits.

### `filters.wall`

Restrict wall downloads to specific wall(s) per creator. When set, the run is **WALL-only** (`download_mode: wall` is required — any other mode raises a config error) and **only the creators listed here are processed** (`usernames` is not consulted for scope).

Keys are creator usernames (or account snowflake IDs for advanced use). Values are either a list of wall names/IDs (an _includes_ list) or a mapping with optional `includes`/`excludes` lists:

```yaml
options:
  download_mode: wall
filters:
  wall:
    creator1: ["FULL VIDEOS"]
    creator2:
      includes: ["Promos", "1234567890123"]
      excludes: ["previews"]
```

Wall names match case-insensitively against the names shown as tabs on the creator's page; all-digit tokens of 10+ characters are treated as wall IDs (visible in DevTools). `excludes` without `includes` means "all walls except these". An empty entry prompts interactively (download all walls? / enter wall names) and errors in non-interactive runs.

CLI equivalent (ephemeral, never written back to `config.yaml`):

```bash
# one creator, bare form
python fansly_downloader_ng.py -u creator1 --wall-filters "FULL VIDEOS,Promos"
# multiple creators, JSON form
python fansly_downloader_ng.py --wall-filters '{"creator1": ["FULL VIDEOS"], "creator2": {"excludes": ["previews"]}}'
```

With `-u` alongside YAML `filters.wall`, `-u` must name a subset of the filter keys and narrows the run to those creators. Wall names containing commas (and excludes) require the JSON form.

### `filters.media`

Skip media outside a min/max file-size or duration window. Each of the four limits (`file_size_min`, `file_size_max`, `duration_min`, `duration_max`) is independent, and each accepts `0` or an absent/empty value to mean "disabled":

```yaml
filters:
  media:
    file_size_min: 100KB
    file_size_max: 4GB
    duration_min: "0:03"
    duration_max: 2h
    by_creator:
      vod_streamer:
        duration_max: 45m
```

Size values accept anything [`pydantic.ByteSize`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/types/#pydantic.types.ByteSize) parses: raw bytes (`102400`), decimal units (`100KB`, `4GB`), or binary units (`1GiB`), case-insensitively and with or without a space before the unit. Duration values accept raw seconds (`90`), colon forms (`1:30`, `1:30:00`), unit suffixes (`45s`, `45m`, `2h`), and compound forms (`2h30m`) via [`pytimeparse2`](https://pypi.org/project/pytimeparse2/).

`by_creator` keys are usernames (sanitized: stripped, leading `@` removed, lowercased — `@VOD_Streamer` and `vod_streamer` collide) or account snowflake IDs, matched in that order. Each override is a partial patch: a field absent from the override inherits the corresponding global limit; a field explicitly set to `0` or `null` disables that limit for that creator regardless of the global value.

Duration limits only ever apply to videos (`mimetype` starting `video/`); images and other media are exempt. Any limit whose evidence is unknown — a video with no known duration, a file with no size evidence yet — passes rather than being filtered; the check only fires when there's data to judge it against.

Size enforcement differs by media shape. Regular (non-streaming) files are checked against the CDN's `Content-Length` response header before the body downloads. HLS/DASH streaming VODs have no upfront size, so they're checked against a declared-bitrate × duration estimate before any segments download — an estimate that can run over a boundary near a `file_size_max` limit since bitrate is nominal, not exact — backed by a mid-download running-total check (tiers 1 and 3 of the HLS strategy) and a final completion-size check as the source of truth once the file is fully assembled.

Media that fails any gate is **never marked downloaded**: the violated limit, and whatever size evidence was observed or estimated, is recorded onto the media's stored metadata (`lastFilteredReason`, `observedContentLength`/`estimatedContentLength`) without touching its downloaded/hash state. Loosening the limits in a later run picks the same item up again, since it was never marked complete.

`filters.media` (both the global limits and `by_creator`) is never consulted for `SINGLE`-mode downloads or live-capture recordings — both are exempt from filtering entirely.

CLI equivalent (ephemeral, never written back to `config.yaml`, and overrides the global layer only — a matching `by_creator` override still wins):

```bash
python fansly_downloader_ng.py --file-size-min 100KB --file-size-max 4GB --duration-min 0:03 --duration-max 2h
```

`0` disables the corresponding limit for that run.

### `filters.media.max_resolution`

Cap download resolution to a tier or a raw pixel count, also under `filters.media`:

```yaml
filters:
  media:
    max_resolution: 1080p
    by_creator:
      photo_heavy:
        max_resolution: 4k
```

Accepts a tier name from the ladder `240p`, `360p`, `480p`, `720p`, `1080p`, `1440p`, `4k` (case-insensitive; `2160p` is also accepted as an alias for `4k`), or a bare shorter-edge pixel integer (e.g. `900`). `0`, `null`, or an empty value disables the cap.

The cap compares against the **shorter edge** (`min(width, height)`) of each candidate rendition, so portrait and landscape media are judged the same way: a 1080x1920 vertical video qualifies at `1080p` just as a 1920x1080 landscape video does.

Fansly serves most media as multiple renditions (a default plus a `variants` list for regular files, multiple playlist variants for HLS). The cap is a rendition selector, not a transcoder: the highest rendition at or below the cap is downloaded as a real, already-smaller file from Fansly's CDN, never re-encoded locally. Only when every known-resolution rendition exceeds the cap is the item skipped as a filtered download, recorded the same way as the size/duration skips above (`lastFilteredReason`, `Filtered [max_resolution]`, `filtered_count`). Media with no known resolution at all passes through untouched, same as the size/duration limits.

`by_creator` overrides for `max_resolution` inherit like the other `filters.media` fields: an override that omits `max_resolution` falls back to the global cap, and an override that sets it to `0`/`null` disables the cap for that creator regardless of the global setting.

The authored form is preserved in `config.yaml` — a `4k` cap stays `4k` after a config save-back; it is never normalized to its pixel threshold on disk.

CLI equivalent (ephemeral, global layer only — a matching `by_creator` override still wins):

```bash
python fansly_downloader_ng.py --max-resolution 1080p
```

`off`, `none`, or `0` disables the cap for that run.

## `cache`

Runtime device-id cache for Fansly API authentication. Managed by the
API layer at runtime; **users should not edit these manually** (changes
are overwritten on the next session-setup pass).

```yaml
cache:
  device_id: null
  device_id_timestamp: null
```

| Field                 | Type          | Default | Description                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `device_id`           | `str \| None` | `null`  | Cached Fansly device identifier; populated automatically on first connect |
| `device_id_timestamp` | `int \| None` | `null`  | Unix timestamp when the cached `device_id` was issued                     |

## `logging`

Eight named loggers plus a `global` defaults block. Two console handlers
and six rotating-file handlers. Each entry has its own `enabled` /
`level`; file entries additionally have orthogonal size and time
rotation axes (both can be active simultaneously — size cap _and_
hourly rotation, whichever trips first). Per-entry `null` rotation
fields fall through to the corresponding `global.default_*`. Format
strings are source-only — see the `Retired fields` callout below.

```yaml
logging:
  global:
    directory: ~/.fansly-downloader-ng/logs
    trace: false
    default_level: INFO
    default_max_size: 104857600 # 100 MiB
    default_rotation_when: h # hourly
    default_rotation_interval: 1
    default_utc: true
    default_backup_count: 5
    default_compression: gz
    default_keep_uncompressed: 2

  # Console handlers
  rich_handler: { enabled: true, level: INFO }
  stash_console: { enabled: true, level: INFO }

  # File handlers — each can override any default
  main_log: { enabled: true, level: INFO }
  json: { enabled: true, level: INFO, backup_count: 10 }
  stash_file: { enabled: true, level: INFO, backup_count: 10 }
  db: { enabled: true, level: INFO, backup_count: 20 }
  websocket: { enabled: true, level: INFO, backup_count: 10 }
  trace: { enabled: false, level: TRACE }
```

### Per-handler entries

**Console handlers** (`rich_handler`, `stash_console`):

| YAML key  | Default                  | Description                                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled` | `true`                   | Disable to drop the handler entirely                                |
| `level`   | `null` → `default_level` | Per-handler level floor. `TRACE` is rejected on console (file-only) |

**File handlers** (`main_log`, `json`, `stash_file`, `db`, `trace`, `websocket`):

### Retired fields

Pre-v0.14 `logging:` was a flat map of `<logger>: <level>` strings. Old
files keep loading via a `model_validator(mode="before")` that lifts the
flat entries into the nested shape:

| Legacy key      | New location                              |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `sqlalchemy`    | `db.level`                                |
| `stash_console` | `stash_console.level`                     |
| `stash_file`    | `stash_file.level`                        |
| `textio`        | `main_log.level` AND `rich_handler.level` |
| `websocket`     | `websocket.level`                         |
| `json` (string) | `json.level`                              |
| `json_level`    | `json.level`                              |

These keys are silently dropped (no migration):

- `logging.global.debug` — replaced by `-v` CLI flag (runtime DEBUG floor
  on every handler) or `logging.global.default_level: DEBUG` (per-handler
  default for handlers whose `level` is `null`)
- `logging.global.verbose` — older alias for the same toggle, also
  retired
- `logging.global.default_format`, `<entry>.format` (every console and
  file entry) — format strings are source-only. The per-handler defaults
  live in `config/logging.py`; the console handler's default is a
  callable that escapes braces / angle brackets and collapses grapheme
  clusters, which a YAML string override would silently degrade.

## `stash_context`

[Stash media server](https://github.com/stashapp/stash) integration
connection. **Optional** — omit the section entirely to disable Stash
integration. When absent, the downloader skips all Stash sync logic
without warning.

```yaml
stash_context:
  scheme: http
  host: localhost
  port: 9999
  apikey: ""
  mapped_path: null
  override_dldir_w_mapped: false
  require_stash_only_mode: false
```

| `mapped_path`             | `str \| None` | `null`        | **Docker / NFS path mapping.** Set this when Stash runs in a container that mounts your download directory under a different path prefix than the scraper sees. For example: if the scraper writes to `/home/user/downloads/` but the Stash container mounts the same share as `/data/fansly/`, set `mapped_path: /data/fansly`. The scraper will substitute the `options.download_directory` prefix with this value in every path it sends to Stash (scan jobs, path filters, regex queries). Leave `null` when both environments share identical paths                                                                                                                    |
| `override_dldir_w_mapped` | `bool`        | `false`       | **Override the download-directory tree with `mapped_path`.** Set `true` when the scraper's per-creator subfolder structure isn't preserved in Stash — for example, files copied to the Stash host and reorganised into `Videos/<studio>/` and `Photos/<studio>/` rather than living under `<creator>_fansly/`. With this flag on, the path the scraper sends to Stash is `mapped_path` itself (no creator-subfolder appended); scan jobs and path filters scope to the whole fansly area, and matching falls back to media-ID code lookups in filenames. Requires `mapped_path` to be set — config load fails otherwise. Leave `false` for the prefix-substitution semantic |
| `require_stash_only_mode` | `bool`        | `false`       | **Engage Stash integration only when `--stash-only` is the download mode.** Set `true` when your Stash server runs on a separate host that the scraper can't reach during downloads — for example, you scrape locally on a workstation, manually copy files to the Stash host, then run `--stash-only` to attribute metadata. With this flag on, regular download runs (`NORMAL`, `TIMELINE`, `MESSAGES`, `WALL`, `SINGLE`, `STORIES`, `COLLECTION`) skip every Stash code path even when `stash_context` is fully populated; `--stash-only` runs engage Stash as usual. Leave `false` to engage Stash after every download mode                                            |

## `monitoring`

Post-batch monitoring daemon configuration. The daemon (entered via
`--daemon` CLI flag or `daemon_mode: true` here) keeps running after the
initial batch download completes — it consumes WebSocket events plus
falls back to timeline/story polling for continuous archiving. See
[monitoring-cadence](../reference/monitoring-cadence.md) for the
intervals and the `main.js` evidence behind them.

```yaml
monitoring:
  daemon_mode: false
  active_duration_minutes: 60
  idle_duration_minutes: 120
  hidden_duration_minutes: 300
  timeline_poll_active_seconds: 180
  timeline_poll_idle_seconds: 600
  story_poll_active_seconds: 30
  story_poll_idle_seconds: 300
  session_baseline: null
  unrecoverable_error_timeout_seconds: 3600
  dashboard_enabled: true
  heartbeat_interval_minutes: 15
  livestream_recording_enabled: false
  livestream_poll_interval_seconds: 30
  livestream_manifest_poll_interval_seconds: 3
```

| `heartbeat_interval_minutes`          | `int`  | `15`    | —                 | How often the simulator-tick loop emits its alive log line. Lower values produce more chatter; higher values reduce log volume                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### `monitoring` — livestream recording

Recording is **opt-in** — set `livestream_recording_enabled: true` to capture
broadcasts. The watcher polls Fansly's online-streams endpoint on the interval
below; when it sees a tracked creator go live it spawns a per-broadcast
recorder that polls the IVS HLS manifest for new segments.

| Field                                       | Type          | Default | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `livestream_recording_enabled`              | `bool`        | `false` | Master switch. `false` (default) suppresses the watcher and recorder entirely                                                                           |
| `livestream_poll_interval_seconds`          | `int`         | `30`    | Seconds between `/streaming/followingstreams/online` polls. Lower values catch broadcasts faster at the cost of API traffic                             |
| `livestream_manifest_poll_interval_seconds` | `int (1..15)` | `3`     | Seconds between HLS manifest refreshes inside an active recording. The ~28s IVS sliding-window buffer means values >5 risk dropping segments under load |

### `monitoring` — session baseline

| Field              | Type               | Default | CLI equivalent                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `session_baseline` | `datetime \| None` | `null`  | `--monitor-since`, `--full-pass` | Optional per-run baseline for `should_process_creator()`. When set, the filter compares against this datetime instead of each creator's stored `MonitorState.lastCheckedAt`. Setting a very old value (e.g. `2000-01-01`) effectively forces a full pass over every creator. When `null`, each creator's own `lastCheckedAt` is used. Naive datetimes are coerced to UTC at parse time |

### `monitoring` — three-tier cadence

The simulator runs a three-tier state machine (`active` → `idle` →
`hidden` → `active`). Only the `active` → `idle` transition models a
real-browser concept (user-inactivity timer); `idle` → `hidden` and
`hidden` → `active` model discrete visibility events (user switches
tab away / back) that don't naturally fire in a headless daemon, so
the daemon approximates them with timed windows.

The poll-interval values (`timeline_poll_*`, `story_poll_*`) mirror
real `main.js` cadence; the duration values are heuristic operational
windows. Tune within narrow ranges — visibly machine-precise rotation
across many hours could itself become an anti-detection fingerprint.
See [monitoring-cadence](../reference/monitoring-cadence.md) for the
real-browser cadences each value is derived from (or, for the
duration windows, approximates) and the broader anti-detection
rationale.

| Field                          | Type  | Default | Semantics                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ----- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `active_duration_minutes`      | `int` | `60`    | Minutes in `active` before rotating to `idle`        |
| `idle_duration_minutes`        | `int` | `120`   | Minutes in `idle` before rotating to `hidden`        |
| `hidden_duration_minutes`      | `int` | `300`   | Minutes in `hidden` before rotating back to `active` |
| `timeline_poll_active_seconds` | `int` | `180`   | Home-timeline poll interval while `active`           |
| `timeline_poll_idle_seconds`   | `int` | `600`   | Home-timeline poll interval while `idle`             |
| `story_poll_active_seconds`    | `int` | `30`    | Story-state poll interval while `active`             |
| `story_poll_idle_seconds`      | `int` | `300`   | Story-state poll interval while `idle`               |

WS events delivered during the `hidden` phase wake the simulator back
to `active` immediately — that part matches real-browser behavior
(tab unhide triggers reconnect + refresh). The
`hidden_duration_minutes` ceiling is the fallback for when no WS event
arrives during the entire hidden window.

Jitter (0-10 s for timeline polls, 0-2 s for story polls) is added on top
of each base interval so the daemon's traffic pattern doesn't look
machine-precise.

### Retired fields (silently dropped on load)

| Field                  | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`              | Never had a runtime consumer; `daemon_mode` is the actual on/off switch                                                                                                                                                             |
| `websocket_subprocess` | Subprocess WebSocket is now the only path — `FanslyWebSocket` is a parent-side shim over a child `multiprocessing.Process` that owns the heartbeat. No toggle (the asymmetric-GIL problem the toggle solved is now fixed by design) |

---

## `logic`

Regex patterns for extracting values from Fansly's served JavaScript.
These rarely need user adjustment — the defaults track Fansly's current
`main.js` shape and are auto-applied on every fresh extraction.

```yaml
logic:
  check_key_pattern: 'this\.checkKey_\s*=\s*["'']([^"'']+)["'']'
  main_js_pattern: '\ssrc\s*=\s*"(main\..*?\.js)"'
```

| Field               | Type  | Default                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `check_key_pattern` | `str` | `r'this\.checkKey_\s*=\s*["'']([^"'']+)["'']'` | Regex matching Fansly's per-deployment request-signing key inside `main.js`. The capture group must yield the raw key string                                                           |
| `main_js_pattern`   | `str` | `r'\ssrc\s*=\s*"(main\..*?\.js)"'`             | Regex matching the `<script src="...">` tag in `index.html` that points at the current `main.js` URL. The capture group must yield the filename (Fansly versions it: `main.<hash>.js`) |

## Download modes

`options.download_mode` is one of:

| Mode         | Behaviour                                                                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NORMAL`     | Default — downloads timeline, messages, collection, wall, and stories per per-creator config |
| `TIMELINE`   | Only public-timeline posts                                                                   |
| `MESSAGES`   | Only direct-message attachments                                                              |
| `COLLECTION` | Only the user's collection (saved/liked content)                                             |
| `WALL`       | Only wall posts                                                                              |
| `SINGLE`     | Single-post download (used with `-p <post_id>`)                                              |
| `STORIES`    | Only ephemeral stories                                                                       |
| `STASH_ONLY` | Skip downloading; only push existing local metadata to Stash                                 |

Case-insensitive at parse time — `normal`, `Normal`, `NORMAL` all resolve
to `DownloadMode.NORMAL`.

## CLI ↔ config mapping

CLI flags override config values when both are supplied. Inverted flags
(`--no-…`, `--hide-…`) flip the corresponding bool to `false` regardless
of the YAML setting.

| `targeted_creator.use_following` | `-uf` / `--use-following`          |

**Authentication**

| Config field                     | CLI flag               |

## First-run / migration behaviour

On startup, the loader performs a one-shot migration pass against
`config.yaml`:

- **Legacy `config.ini` migration** — if a `config.yaml` doesn't exist
  but a `config.ini` does, the loader converts the `.ini` to YAML and
  preserves the original `.ini` as a backup.
- **Retired keys are silently stripped** — the `_DROPPED_FIELDS` set in
  `OptionsSection` lists keys that the project no longer reads. They're
  removed from the parsed dict before validation so `extra="forbid"`
  doesn't reject upgrade paths.
- **Comments survive** — your hand-edited comments, anchors, and key
  order are preserved across the rewrite via `ruamel.yaml` round-tripping.
- **Typos raise an error** — unknown keys that don't match a retirement
  raise `ValidationError` at startup with the unknown key name and its
  section. This catches misspellings before they silently affect behaviour.
