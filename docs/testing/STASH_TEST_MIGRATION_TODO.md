# Stash Test Refactor Guide

**Goal**: Migrate all Stash tests to mock only at external boundaries (HTTP/GraphQL), not internal methods.

**Created**: 2025-11-18
**Enforcement**: `tests/conftest.py:50-100`

---

## Overview

### The Problem

Tests were mocking internal methods, creating "faux integration tests" that:

- ❌ Claimed to use real processors but mocked away actual code execution
- ❌ Never tested real async session handling, GraphQL serialization, or database relationships
- ❌ **HID CRITICAL PRODUCTION BUGS** (see Lessons Learned below)

### The Solution

Mock only at true external boundaries:

- ✅ **Fansly API**: RESPX for HTTP responses
- ✅ **Stash GraphQL**: RESPX for HTTP responses (not the Python dict from `execute()`)
- ✅ Use real database sessions, real Strawberry objects, real factories

---

## Test Categories

All tests organized by directory location. Each needs migration to one of two patterns.

### Category A: StashClient Tests — ✅ COMPLETE (directory deleted)

**Original Location**: `tests/stash/client/` (12 files, ~119 functions)
**Migration**: → `stash_client` + `stash_cleanup_tracker` (integration) OR respx (unit)

> **Note:** The `tests/stash/client/` directory was deleted during the stash-graphql-client refactor. All tests were either migrated to `tests/stash/processing/unit/` or removed as redundant. All items below are confirmed complete.

| File                      | Violations | Status                    |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- |
| `test_gallery_mixin.py`   | 30         | ✅ (migrated/removed)     |
| `test_tag_mixin_new.py`   | 30         | ✅ (migrated/removed)     |

## Migration Patterns

### Unit Tests → `respx_stash_processor`

```python
# BEFORE: Mocked internal method ❌
async def test_example(real_stash_processor):
    real_stash_processor._find_stash_files_by_path = AsyncMock(return_value=[])

# AFTER: Mock at HTTP boundary ✅
async def test_example(respx_stash_processor):
    respx.post("http://localhost:9999/graphql").mock(
        side_effect=[
            httpx.Response(200, json={"data": {"findScenes": {"scenes": [], "count": 0}}}),
            httpx.Response(200, json={"data": {"findPerformers": {"performers": [], "count": 0}}}),
        ]
    )
```

### Integration Tests → `real_stash_processor` + `stash_cleanup_tracker`

```python
# BEFORE: Manual try/finally cleanup ❌
async def test_example(stash_client):
    scene_id = None
    try:
        scene = await stash_client.create_scene(...)
        scene_id = scene.id
    finally:
        if scene_id:
            await stash_client.execute("mutation { sceneDestroy(...) }")

# AFTER: Automatic cleanup ✅
async def test_example(stash_client, stash_cleanup_tracker):
    async with stash_cleanup_tracker(stash_client) as cleanup:
        scene = await stash_client.create_scene(...)
        cleanup["scenes"].append(scene.id)
        # Automatic cleanup on exit
```

### Spy Pattern for Internal Orchestration Tests

For unit tests that verify internal method coordination (e.g., early returns, call counts):

```python
# BEFORE: Mocking internal method with return_value/side_effect ❌
with patch.object(gallery_mixin, "_has_media_content", AsyncMock(return_value=False)):
    result = await gallery_mixin._check_aggregated_posts([post1, post2])

# AFTER: Spy pattern with wraps - real code executes ✅
original_has_media = respx_stash_processor._has_media_content
call_count = 0

async def spy_has_media(item):
    nonlocal call_count
    call_count += 1
    return await original_has_media(item)  # Real code executes!

with patch.object(respx_stash_processor, "_has_media_content", wraps=spy_has_media):
    result = await respx_stash_processor._check_aggregated_posts([post1, post2])

    # Verify orchestration
    assert result is False
    assert call_count == 2  # Both posts checked
```

**Why this matters:**

- Real code path executes (not mocked behavior)
- Tests actual orchestration logic (early returns, loops, error handling)
- Catches regressions in internal coordination
- Similar concept to `capture_graphql_calls` but for internal methods

---

## Critical Technical Patterns

### 1. Multiple GraphQL Calls Need Multiple Responses

When code makes sequential GraphQL calls, provide a response for EACH:

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Only one response for 5 calls → StopIteration error
respx.post("http://localhost:9999/graphql").mock(
    return_value=httpx.Response(200, json={"data": {"findScenes": {...}}})
)

# ✅ CORRECT: List of responses matching call sequence
respx.post("http://localhost:9999/graphql").mock(
    side_effect=[
        httpx.Response(200, json={"data": {"findScenes": {...}}}),       # Call 1
        httpx.Response(200, json={"data": {"findPerformers": {...}}}),   # Call 2
        httpx.Response(200, json={"data": {"findStudios": {...}}}),      # Call 3
        httpx.Response(200, json={"data": {"findStudios": {...}}}),      # Call 4
        httpx.Response(200, json={"data": {"sceneUpdate": {...}}}),      # Call 5
    ]
)
```

### 2. Auto-Capture with `stash_cleanup_tracker`

The cleanup tracker auto-captures IDs from create mutations (default: `auto_capture=True`). Fast-path optimization checks for "Create" in response keys before detailed inspection. Tests can opt-out (`auto_capture=False`) only if using `capture_graphql_calls` with proper request/response validation and manual ID tracking.

### 3. Permanent GraphQL Call Assertions (REQUIRED)

**Every respx and real stash test MUST verify both request AND response for each GraphQL call.**

This is NOT debug code - it's permanent regression protection that:

- Documents expected call sequence in the test itself
- Catches call order changes or unexpected calls
- Reveals caching behavior (e.g., `@async_lru_cache` skipping calls)
- Verifies correct request variables, not just that responses work

```python
import json

# After calling the method under test:
await respx_stash_processor._process_media(media, item, account, result)

# REQUIRED: Assert exact call count
assert len(graphql_route.calls) == 7, "Expected exactly 7 GraphQL calls"

calls = graphql_route.calls

# REQUIRED: Verify EACH call's request and response
# Call 0: findImage (by stash_id)
req0 = json.loads(calls[0].request.content)
assert "findImage" in req0["query"]
assert req0["variables"]["id"] == "stash_456"
resp0 = calls[0].response.json()
assert "findImage" in resp0["data"]

# Call 1: findPerformers (by name)
req1 = json.loads(calls[1].request.content)
assert "findPerformers" in req1["query"]
assert req1["variables"]["performer_filter"]["name"]["value"] == account.username
resp1 = calls[1].response.json()
assert resp1["data"]["findPerformers"]["count"] == 0

# ... verify ALL calls
```

**Example - Verifying cache behavior:**

```python
# Verify @async_lru_cache skips performer lookups after first media object
performer_calls_after_first = [
    i for i in range(8, 12)
    if "findPerformers" in json.loads(calls[i].request.content)["query"]
]
assert len(performer_calls_after_first) == 0, (
    f"Found unexpected findPerformers calls at indices: {performer_calls_after_first}"
)
```

### 4. VideoFile/ImageFile Schema Validation

Stash types have strict required fields:

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Minimal file dict → TypeError
files=[{"path": "/path/to/file.mp4"}]

# ✅ CORRECT: Complete VideoFile schema
files=[{
    "id": "file_123",
    "path": "/path/to/file.mp4",
    "basename": "file.mp4",
    "size": 1024,
    "parent_folder_id": None,
    "format": "mp4",
    "width": 1920,
    "height": 1080,
    "duration": 120.0,
    "video_codec": "h264",
    "audio_codec": "aac",
    "frame_rate": 30.0,
    "bit_rate": 5000000,
}]

# ✅ CORRECT: Complete ImageFile schema
visual_files=[{
    "id": "file_789",
    "path": "/path/to/image.jpg",
    "basename": "image.jpg",
    "size": 512000,
    "parent_folder_id": None,
    "mod_time": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "fingerprints": [],
    "width": 1920,
    "height": 1080,
}]
```

### 5. Testing Real Constraint Violations

For integration tests, test REAL constraint violations that trigger actual GraphQL errors:

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Stash silently accepts invalid data
result = await stash_client.set_gallery_cover(gallery_id, image_id="99999")
assert result is False  # FAILS - Stash returns True!

# ✅ CORRECT: Real constraint violation triggers GraphQL error
with capture_graphql_calls(stash_client) as calls:
    with pytest.raises(Exception, match="Image # must greater than zero"):
        await stash_client.gallery_chapter_create(
            gallery_id=empty_gallery_id,
            title="Invalid Chapter",
            image_index=1,  # No images in gallery!
        )
    assert len(calls) == 1
    assert "galleryChapterCreate" in calls[0]["query"]
```

---

## Lessons Learned: Production Bugs Hidden by Mocks

### The MissingGreenlet Bug

**What happened**: Production code had sync/async session mismatches causing `MissingGreenlet` errors.

**Why mocks hid it**:

```python
# Test with mocks - NEVER executed real relationship loading
real_stash_processor._find_stash_files_by_path = AsyncMock(return_value=[scene])
# ↑ This bypass meant we never hit the actual code that loaded relationships
```

**What the migrated test caught immediately**:

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Using sync session in async test
session_sync.add(media)
session_sync.commit()
test_media.variants = {variant}  # BOOM: MissingGreenlet error

# ✅ CORRECT: Use async session with proper awaits
session.add(media)
await session.commit()
await session.refresh(test_media, attribute_names=["variants"])
test_media.variants = {variant}  # Now safe
```

**Impact**: Migration caught this production bug on first test run. This validates the entire migration effort.

### The GIF Processing Bugs (Chain of 4)

**What happened**: Animated GIFs in Stash are stored as `VideoFile` type, not `ImageFile`. This caused a cascade of 4 interrelated bugs that were never caught because mocked tests never executed real GraphQL deserialization or type handling.

**Bug 1: int/str Type Mismatch in stash_id_map**

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Production code used int keys
stash_id_map = {media.stash_id: media.id for media in media_objects}
# But GraphQL returns string IDs: "123" not 123
stash_id = stash_obj.id  # Returns "123" (str)
media_id = stash_id_map.get(stash_id)  # None! Key mismatch

# ✅ FIX: Convert to str when building map
stash_id_map = {str(media.stash_id): media.id for media in media_objects}
```

**Why mocks hid it**: Mocks returned pre-constructed objects, never testing real dict→object serialization where GraphQL always returns string IDs.

**Bug 2: GraphQL Fragments Missing VideoFile for Images**

```python
# ❌ WRONG: IMAGE_FIELDS only queried ImageFile fields
IMAGE_FIELDS = """
    visual_files {
        ...ImageFileFields
    }
"""
# GIFs returned: {"visual_files": [{}]}  # Empty! VideoFile fields not requested

# ✅ FIX: Query both file types
IMAGE_FIELDS = """
    visual_files {
        ...ImageFileFields
        ...VideoFileFields
    }
"""
```

**Why mocks hid it**: Mocked GraphQL responses were hand-crafted with correct data. Real Stash returns empty objects when fragments don't match the actual type.

**Bug 3: Image.from_dict() Crashed on VideoFile Data**

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Assumed all visual_files are ImageFile
for f in filtered_data["visual_files"]:
    image.visual_files.append(ImageFile(**f))
# TypeError: ImageFile.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'format'
# ('format' is a VideoFile-only field)

# ✅ FIX: Detect type and create appropriate object
for f in filtered_data["visual_files"]:
    if "format" in f or "duration" in f or "video_codec" in f:
        visual_files.append(VideoFile(**f))  # GIF stored as video
    else:
        visual_files.append(ImageFile(**f))
```

**Why mocks hid it**: Tests used `MagicMock(spec=Image)` or factory objects - never exercised `from_dict()` deserialization with real GraphQL responses.

**Bug 4: \_get_image_file_from_stash_obj Rejected VideoFile**

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Only accepted ImageFile type
if hasattr(file_data, "__type_name__") and file_data.__type_name__ == "ImageFile":
    return file_data
# GIFs have __type_name__ == "VideoFile" → returned None → lookup failed

# ✅ FIX: Accept both types
if hasattr(file_data, "__type_name__") and file_data.__type_name__ in (
    "ImageFile",
    "VideoFile",  # Animated GIFs in Stash
):
    return file_data
```

**Why mocks hid it**: Mocked `_find_stash_files_by_path` returned pre-built objects, bypassing the type-checking code path entirely.

**Impact**: These 4 bugs formed a chain - fixing one revealed the next. Real integration tests with Docker Stash exposed all 4 in one debugging session. Mocked tests had passed for months while GIF files silently failed in production.

### Why This Migration Matters

The original tests were "faux integration tests" that provided false confidence:

- ❌ Claimed to use `real_stash_processor`, but mocked away anything that would have called it
- ❌ Mocked internal methods with `AsyncMock` (bypassed actual code execution)
- ❌ Never tested real async session handling, GraphQL serialization, or database relationships

The migrated tests are true unit tests with complete flow coverage:

- ✅ Use `respx_stash_processor` with HTTP mocking at the edge boundary
- ✅ Execute the ENTIRE real code path through all internal methods
- ✅ Use real database objects, real async sessions, real relationship loading
- ✅ Mock ONLY external HTTP calls to Stash GraphQL API

---

## Valid Exceptions to Mock-Free Testing

When mocking internal methods IS acceptable:

1. **Edge Case Coverage**: Testing error handling paths difficult to trigger via external API

   ```python
   # ✅ ACCEPTABLE: Simulating rare failure condition
   respx_stash_processor._find_stash_files_by_path = AsyncMock(
       side_effect=Exception("Disk failure")
   )
   ```

2. **Deep Call Trees (3-4+ layers)**: When setup would require complex external state

3. **Test Infrastructure** (`tests/stash/types/`): Unit tests for data conversion, change tracking

**Review Process for Exceptions**:

- Requires user confirmation, not automated guesses
- Consider if respx at HTTP boundary could work instead
- Document WHY mocking is needed

**Example - Why User Confirmation Matters**:

When migrating `test_client_base.py`, the respx approach didn't work for testing initialization errors because gql doesn't make HTTP calls during init with `fetch_schema_from_transport=False`. Without user guidance, the automated approach would have been to mock internal methods like `StashClientBase.initialize` - creating another "faux" test.

Instead, user prompting led to the correct solution: patch the **external** `gql.Client.__init__` to enable schema fetching, then respx catches the connection error. This tests real code paths while only changing variables used in external library initialization.

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Automated guess would mock internal method
with patch.object(StashClientBase, "initialize", side_effect=Exception("Connection refused")):
    ...

# ✅ CORRECT: User-guided solution patches external library
def patched_init(self, *args, **kwargs):
    kwargs["fetch_schema_from_transport"] = True  # Enable HTTP during init
    return original_init(self, *args, **kwargs)

with patch.object(Client, "__init__", patched_init):
    respx.post(...).mock(side_effect=httpx.ConnectError("Connection refused"))
```

This is exactly why exceptions require user review - the human sees solutions that preserve real code execution.

### Pass 1: Complete ✅ - All Documented Files Migrated

| Category        | Files | Status                  |
| --------------- | ----- | ----------------------- |
| A (Client)      | 0     | ✅ COMPLETE             |
| B (Unit)        | 0     | ✅ COMPLETE             |
| C (Integration) | 0     | ✅ COMPLETE             |
| D (Other)       | 0     | ✅ COMPLETE             |
| **Total**       | **0** | **🎉 PASS 1 COMPLETE!** |

**Pass 1 Final Actions:**

- Fixed worker crash: Added `stash_cleanup_tracker` to `test_missing_account_handling`
- Removed broken import in `tests/stash/processing/test_integration.py`
- Deleted redundant file: `tests/stash/integration/test_stash_processing_integration.py` (all 3 tests were complete duplicates)

### Pass 2: GraphQL Assertion Compliance (IN PROGRESS)

**Status**: As the first pass progressed, the GraphQL assertion rules (Section 3) evolved and were elaborated on. Many tests migrated during Pass 1 don't fully comply with the current state of the rules.

**Known Issues** (Manual audit completed 2025-11-30):

- **53+ violations found** across multiple test files
- Common patterns:
  - Meaningless assertions: `assert len(calls) >= 0` (always true)
  - Incomplete request verification: Only checks query name, not request variables
  - Missing response verification: Some tests only verify requests

**Files with Known Violations**:

- `tests/stash/client/test_tag_mixin_new.py` - 3 meaningless assertions + multiple incomplete
- `tests/stash/client/test_tag_mixin.py` - 8 incomplete request checks
- `tests/stash/client/test_scene_mixin.py` - 13 incomplete request checks
- `tests/stash/client/test_marker_mixin.py` - 6 incomplete request checks
- `tests/stash/client/test_gallery_mixin.py` - 5 incomplete request checks
- `tests/stash/processing/integration/test_media_processing.py` - 11 incomplete request checks
- `tests/stash/processing/integration/test_message_processing.py` - 1 incomplete request check
- `tests/stash/processing/integration/test_timeline_processing.py` - 1 incomplete request check

**Next Steps**:

1. Systematic review and fix of all 53+ violations
2. Focus on files with highest violation counts first
3. Ensure all GraphQL assertions verify BOTH request variables AND response data
