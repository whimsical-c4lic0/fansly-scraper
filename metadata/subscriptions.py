"""Subscription / SubscriptionPlan / SubscriptionPromo + FollowEvent
processing.

Persists the three response shapes from ``/api/v1/subscriptions``
(``subscriptions[]``, ``subscriptionPlans[]``, nested ``promos[]``) and
detects per-creator access-state transitions that should invalidate
download dedup short-circuits.

Also exposes ``record_follow_observation`` for the follow-state audit log.

Triggers that produce an entry in the returned access-change set:
- Subscription status flips inactive (or missing) → active (3)
- subscriptionTierId changes while status remains active (tier upgrade)

Renewal-only changes (endsAt extension, updatedAt advance) are NOT
treated as access changes — they extend the existing access window
without unlocking new content.
