![Fansly Downloader NG Screenshot](resources/fansly_ng_screenshot.png)

This is a rewrite/refactoring of [Avnsx](https://github.com/Avnsx)'s original [Fansly Downloader](https://github.com/Avnsx/fansly-downloader). **Fansly Downloader NG** supports new features:

- Full command-line support for all options
- `config.ini` not required to start the program anymore - a `config.ini` with all program defaults will be generated automatically
- Support for minimal `config.ini` files - missing options will be added from program defaults automatically
- True multi-user support - put one or more creators as a list into `config.ini` (`username = creator1, creator2, creator3`) or supply via command-line
- Run it in non-interactive mode (`-ni`) without any user intervention - eg. when downloading while being away from the computer
- You may also run it in fully silent mode without the close prompt at the very end (`-ni -npox`) - eg. running **Fansly Downloader NG** from another script or from a scheduled task/cron job
- Logs all relevant messages (`Info`, `Warning`, `Error`, ...) of the last few sessions to `fansly_downloader_ng.log`. A history of 5 log files with a maximum size of 1 MiB will be preserved and can be deleted at your own discretion.
- Easier-to-extend, modern, modular and robust codebase
- It doesn't care about starring the repository

_There are still pieces missing like an appropriate wiki update._

📋 [Detailed description on each of the components of this software](https://github.com/prof79/fansly-downloader-ng/wiki/Explanation-of-provided-programs-&-their-functionality)

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

### PostgreSQL Migration (v0.11.0+)

**IMPORTANT:** Starting with version 0.11.0, Fansly Downloader NG has migrated from SQLite to PostgreSQL for metadata storage. This is a **breaking change** that requires action before upgrading.

#### Database Evolution Timeline

- **v0.9.9 and earlier (2024-06-28)**: No metadata database - downloads tracked by filenames only
- **v0.10.x (late 2024)**: SQLite metadata database introduced for better deduplication and tracking
- **v0.11.0+ (current)**: PostgreSQL for higher performance and data reliability

#### Why the Change?

The migration to PostgreSQL provides several critical improvements:

- **Better Performance**: Significantly faster queries and bulk operations on large datasets
- **Superior Concurrency**: True multi-user/multi-process support without database locking issues
- **Network Support**: Reliable operation with databases on network paths (NAS, SMB shares)
- **Advanced Features**: Better support for complex queries, transactions, and data integrity

#### Migration Requirements

##### PostgreSQL must be installed and configured before running v0.11.0+

1. **Install PostgreSQL**

   - **macOS**: `brew install postgresql@17` or download from [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/)
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib` or equivalent for your distro
   - **Windows**: Download installer from [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)

2. **Create Database and User**

   ```bash
   # Start PostgreSQL service
   # macOS (Homebrew): brew services start postgresql@17
   # Linux: sudo systemctl start postgresql
   # Windows: Service starts automatically after installation

   # Create database and user
   createdb fansly_metadata
   psql -d fansly_metadata -c "CREATE USER fansly_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';"
   psql -d fansly_metadata -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE fansly_metadata TO fansly_user;"
   psql -d fansly_metadata -c "GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO fansly_user;"
   ```

3. **Migrate Existing Data** (if upgrading from v0.10.x with SQLite)

   **Note:** If you're upgrading from v0.9.x or earlier (before metadata tracking), skip this step - there's no SQLite database to migrate.

   Use the provided migration script to transfer your existing SQLite metadata to PostgreSQL:

   ```bash
   python scripts/migrate_to_postgres.py \
       --sqlite-file metadata_db.sqlite3 \
       --pg-host localhost \
       --pg-database fansly_metadata \
       --pg-user fansly_user
   ```

   The script will:

   - Create a backup of your SQLite database (with timestamp)
   - Copy all tables and data to PostgreSQL
   - Verify the migration completed successfully
   - Optionally delete the SQLite file after successful migration (use `--delete-sqlite`)

4. **Update Configuration**

   Update your `config.ini` with PostgreSQL connection details. Use the following individual parameters in the `[Options]` section:

   ```ini
   [Options]
   pg_host = localhost
   pg_port = 5432
   pg_database = fansly_metadata
   pg_user = fansly_user
   pg_password = your_secure_password
   pg_pool_size = 5
   pg_max_overflow = 10
   pg_pool_timeout = 30
   ```

#### Backward Compatibility

**There is NO backward compatibility with SQLite.** Once you upgrade to v0.11.0+, you must use PostgreSQL. If you need to continue using SQLite, remain on v0.10.x releases.

For detailed migration instructions and troubleshooting, see the [PostgreSQL Migration Guide](scripts/migrate_to_postgres.py).

### JavaScript Dependencies (Node.js/npm Required)

**NEW REQUIREMENT:** Fansly Downloader NG now requires Node.js and specific JavaScript libraries for checkKey extraction and browser compliance detection.

#### Why These Dependencies?

Fansly's authentication system requires extracting a `checkKey` value from their JavaScript bundles. To do this reliably and securely, we use:

- **acorn**: Industry-standard JavaScript parser for AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) generation
- **acorn-walk**: AST traversal library to find specific code patterns
- **JSPyBridge** (Python `javascript` package): Required for Python-JavaScript communication

#### Installation Requirements

1. **Install Node.js**

   **Recommended**: Use [nvm (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for easy version management:

   ```bash
   # Install nvm (macOS/Linux)
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.0/install.sh | bash

   # Install Node.js (version specified in .nvmrc)
   nvm install
   nvm use
   ```

   **Alternative**: Download and install directly from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)

2. **Install JavaScript Dependencies**

   ```bash
   # In the project directory
   npm install acorn acorn-walk
   ```

3. **Install JSPyBridge** (Required - included in Poetry dependencies)

   JSPyBridge is already included when you run `poetry install`. This provides efficient Python-JavaScript communication for checkKey extraction.

   **Note:** If you installed manually with pip instead of Poetry, run:

   ```bash
   pip install javascript
   ```

#### Version Management

The project includes an `.nvmrc` file (currently set to `v25.0.0`) for consistent Node.js versions across environments. When using nvm:

```bash
# Automatically use the correct Node.js version
nvm use
```

**Important:** JSPyBridge detects and uses your local nvm installation if available, ensuring compatibility with the Node.js version specified in `.nvmrc`.

For more details, see [CheckKey Extraction Documentation](docs/reference/CHECKKEY_JSPYBRIDGE.md).

## 🏗️ Setup

On Windows you can just download and run the [executable version](https://github.com/prof79/fansly-downloader-ng/releases/latest) - skip the entire setup section and go directly to [Quick Start](https://github.com/prof79/fansly-downloader-ng#-quick-start).

### Python Environment

If your operating system is not compatible with executable versions of **Fansly Downloader NG** (only Windows supported for `.exe`) or you want to use the Python sources directly, please [download and extract](https://github.com/prof79/fansly-downloader-ng/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) _or_ clone the repository and ensure that [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed on your system.

**Note:** This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. Poetry automatically creates and manages virtual environments for you.

#### Installation Steps

1. **Install Poetry** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   # Linux, macOS, Windows (WSL)
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

   # Or using pip (alternative method)
   pip install poetry
   ```

   **Note:** You may need to add Poetry to your PATH. See [Poetry installation docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for details.

2. **Install Node.js and npm Dependencies:**

   Fansly Downloader NG requires Node.js for checkKey extraction from Fansly's JavaScript bundles.

   **Option A: Using nvm (Recommended)**

   ```bash
   # Install nvm (macOS/Linux)
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.0/install.sh | bash

   # Navigate to project directory
   cd fansly-downloader-ng

   # Install Node.js (version specified in .nvmrc)
   nvm install
   nvm use

   # Install npm dependencies
   npm install acorn acorn-walk
   ```

   **Option B: Using Node.js directly**

   ```bash
   # Download and install Node.js LTS from nodejs.org
   # Then navigate to project directory and install npm dependencies
   cd fansly-downloader-ng
   npm install acorn acorn-walk
   ```

   **For Windows users:**

   - Download Node.js installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - After installation, open PowerShell/CMD in the project directory
   - Run: `npm install acorn acorn-walk`

3. **Install Python Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   # Option A: Install with browser authentication support (RECOMMENDED)
   poetry install --no-root --with browser-auth

   # Option B: Install without browser authentication (username/password only)
   poetry install --no-root
   ```

   #### Understanding `--with browser-auth`

   The `browser-auth` optional dependency group enables **automatic token extraction** from your browser's storage:

   **What it does:**
   - Extracts your Fansly authentication token directly from browser storage (LevelDB for Chromium browsers, SQLite for Firefox)
   - **No need to manually copy tokens or enter credentials**
   - Supports: Chrome, Edge, Opera, Opera GX, Brave (via `plyvel-ci`), and Firefox (via built-in `sqlite3`)

   **When to use it:**
   - ✅ **Recommended** - Most convenient authentication method
   - ✅ You regularly use a supported browser to access Fansly
   - ✅ You want automatic, secure token extraction without manual steps

   **When you DON'T need it:**
   - ❌ You prefer to use username/password authentication
   - ❌ You use an unsupported browser (Safari, etc.)
   - ❌ You want minimal dependencies

   **Technical Details:**
   - Adds `plyvel-ci` (LevelDB reader for Chromium-based browsers)
   - Firefox support works without browser-auth (uses Python's built-in `sqlite3`)
   - All token extraction happens **locally** on your machine - nothing is sent to external servers

   **Note:** The `javascript` package (JSPyBridge) is automatically installed by Poetry and provides efficient Python-JavaScript communication for checkKey extraction.

4. **Additional Platform Requirements:**

   **Linux:** You may need to install the Python `Tkinter` module separately:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk
   ```

   **Windows/macOS:** The `Tkinter` module is typically included in the Python installer.

#### Running the Application

```bash
# Run with Poetry
poetry run python fansly_downloader_ng.py

# Or activate the Poetry shell first, then run normally
poetry shell
python fansly_downloader_ng.py
```

#### For Developers

Install development and testing dependencies:

```bash
poetry install --no-root --with dev,typing,test,browser-auth
```

**Important:** Raw Python code versions of **Fansly Downloader NG** do not receive automatic updates. If an update is available, you will be notified but need to manually download and set up the [current repository](https://github.com/prof79/fansly-downloader-ng/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) again.
