"""Logging Module

This module provides custom logging handlers for advanced log management.
The main handler class SizeTimeRotatingHandler supports:
- Combined size and time-based log rotation
- Multiple compression formats (gz, bz2, xz)
- UTC time support
- Configurable backup count and intervals
- Proper cleanup and compression

Note: All logger configuration is now centralized in config/logging.py.
This module only provides the handler implementation.

class SizeAndTimeRotatingFileHandler(BaseRotatingHandler):
    """A logging handler that rotates files based on both size and time.

    This handler extends BaseRotatingHandler to provide combined size and time-based
    rotation with compression support. It can rotate logs when either the file size
    exceeds a threshold or when a time interval has passed.

    Attributes:
        maxBytes: Maximum file size in bytes before rotation
        backupCount: Number of backup files to keep
        utc: Whether to use UTC time for rotation calculations
        compression: Compression format to use ('gz', 'bz2', 'xz')
        interval: Time interval between rotations in seconds
        rolloverAt: Timestamp for next scheduled rotation
        when: Time unit for rotation ('s', 'm', 'h', 'd', 'w')
        keep_uncompressed: Number of most recent backup files to keep uncompressed

    Note:
        - Rotation occurs if either size or time threshold is exceeded
        - Compressed files are automatically cleaned up
        - UTC time support for consistent rotation across timezones
        - Files are kept uncompressed based on their recency (e.g., keep_uncompressed=2
          keeps log.1 and log.2 uncompressed while compressing older files)
        - db_logger_name may be set dynamically for debugging purposes
