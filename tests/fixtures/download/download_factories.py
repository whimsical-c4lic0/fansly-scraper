"""FactoryBoy factories for DownloadState and related download objects.

This module provides factories for creating test instances of download state objects
using FactoryBoy. These factories create real download state objects with sensible defaults,
replacing the need for MagicMock usage in tests.

Usage:
    from tests.fixtures.download import DownloadStateFactory
    from tests.fixtures.utils.test_isolation import snowflake_id

    # Create a basic download state for testing
    state = DownloadStateFactory()

    # Create a state with specific values
    state = DownloadStateFactory(
        creator_name="testuser",
        creator_id=snowflake_id()
    )
