"""WebSocket test doubles — two layers of fakes for different test surfaces.

Two distinct stubs live here, one per test surface:

* ``FakeSocket`` is the **transport-level** fake — it stands in for the
  ``websockets.client`` connection object that ``FanslyWebSocket.connect``
  receives. Use it when the test wants real ``FanslyWebSocket`` behavior
  (auth flow, ping/pong, message decoding) but no actual network.

* ``FakeWS`` is the **client-level** fake — it stands in for the entire
  ``FanslyWebSocket`` instance. Use it when the test wants to inject a
  pre-made WS into something like ``daemon/runner.py`` via ``ws_factory``
  and drive service events synchronously via ``fire(svc, type, payload)``
  without exercising the real client at all.

Both belong here per the project-wide rule (CLAUDE.md): "All pytest
fixtures, fakes, factories, and reusable test helpers MUST live in
``tests/fixtures/``" — never in ``conftest.py`` or ``test_*.py`` files.

Usage::

    from unittest.mock import patch
    from tests.fixtures.api.fake_websocket import FakeSocket, auth_response

    fake = FakeSocket(recv_messages=[auth_response()])

    async def fake_connect(**kwargs):
        return fake

    with patch("api.websocket.ws_client.connect", side_effect=fake_connect):
        # call code that opens a WebSocket
        ...

The FanslyApi → FanslyWebSocket auth flow (verified in api/fansly.py:548-584
and api/websocket.py:449) expects the first recv() to return a type-1 message
whose ``d`` payload is a JSON string containing a ``session`` object with at
least ``id`` and ``websocketSessionId`` fields. ``auth_response()`` builds
that by default; pass different args to test auth-failure paths.
