"""Integration test for MediaProcessingMixin._split_scene_for_file.

TRUE INTEGRATION TEST: hits the real Docker Stash instance.

Scenario: our downloaded file is a SECONDARY on a scene that another source
OWNS (its primary is a foreign file). The split CREATEs a brand-new Scene that
owns our file; the Stash server reassigns our file off the shared scene
(per SceneCreateInput: "Files will be reassigned from existing scenes if
applicable. Files must not already be primary for another scene.").

The split only fires when our file is primary of NO scene. The setup uses
``scene_assign_file`` whose primary/secondary semantics are determined
EMPIRICALLY here via the precondition assertions (see the docstring on the
test).
