"""Integration test for the file-first Stash processing flow.

TRUE INTEGRATION TEST: hits the real Docker Stash instance (localhost:9999).

Exercises ``StashProcessing._run_file_first`` end-to-end against real Stash
files. The flow sweeps every Stash file under the creator's root, adjudicates
each against the creator's downloaded media (gathered from posts), composes one
gallery per post, flushes via a single ``save_all``, and persists the affected
Media rows back to the FDNG metadata DB.

The test LEADS WITH POSTS (not messages): ``_gather_creator_posts`` keys only
on ``accountId == account.id and bool(attachments)`` — no Group.users wiring is
needed, so the gather provably finds the seeded posts (a guard asserts this so
the flow cannot false-green on an empty gather).

The stamped-entity assertion leans on IMAGES: ``_adjudicate_image``'s find-
fragment route is the reliable path on this server, whereas swept VideoFiles
depend on the unreliable ``file.scenes`` reverse field (see test_scene_split.py).
Scene-split is left disabled (default); owned-image stamping + gallery
composition satisfy the bar.

    """STASH_ONLY's cold cache still archives content (regression for #15).

    The STASH_ONLY path runs no ``download_*`` populate, so the only thing
    warming the FDNG identity map is the startup ``preload`` — which resolves
    ``belongs_to``/``habtm`` but NOT ``has_many`` reverse-FK lists. That left
    ``Post.attachments`` empty, the gather blind, and the whole creator a silent
    no-op. ``_run_file_first`` now rebuilds those lists before gathering.

    This test reproduces the real cold path end-to-end against live Docker Stash
    with ACTUAL objects — no stubbed sweep, gather, or reconstruction:

      - seed posts whose media ``local_filename`` are REAL Stash file paths, but
        DO NOT set ``post.attachments`` by hand (that is the warm-cache shortcut
        the sibling test takes — and exactly what hid this bug);
      - drop the FDNG identity map and rebuild it with the startup ``preload``
        order, so the cache is genuinely cold;
      - PROVE the cache is cold: the bare gather returns nothing (pre-flow, the
        creator is invisible — the defect surface);
      - run the REAL ``_run_file_first`` and assert it archives content anyway.

    Discriminator: revert the in-flow reconstruction and the cold gather stays
    empty -> the flow produces nothing -> ``produced_something`` fails.
