"""Integration tests for _update_stash_metadata with real infrastructure.

These tests use:
1. Real PostgreSQL database with FactoryBoy factories
2. Real Docker Stash instance via StashClient (NO MOCKS)
3. End-to-end testing of metadata update workflow

This differs from unit tests which mock everything, and from other integration tests
which mock the Stash API. These tests verify the full workflow works with real services.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Images CANNOT be created via Stash API (no ImageCreateInput exists)
- Images must be pre-scanned into Stash from filesystem
- Scenes CAN be created via API (SceneCreateInput exists)
- These tests focus on Scene objects which can be fully tested end-to-end
