"""Unit tests for stash processing module - core functionality.

Migrated to use respx_stash_processor fixture with proper edge-mocking:
- Use respx to mock HTTP responses at Stash GraphQL boundary
- Use entity_store for database persistence (Pydantic EntityStore)
- Use real StashProcessing, StashClient, Database instances
- Do NOT mock internal class methods
