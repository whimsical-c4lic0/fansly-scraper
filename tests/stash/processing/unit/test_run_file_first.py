"""Unit tests for ``StashProcessing._run_file_first`` failure handling.

Two orchestration guarantees, both exercised end-to-end with the REAL sweep,
adjudication, and ``save_all`` (no SUT-method stubs) — only the Stash HTTP edge
is routed via respx:

1. **Per-file isolation** — one swept file that raises during adjudication must
   NOT abort the creator's sweep; the loop continues to the next file.
2. **Batch-flush propagation** — a ``save_all`` (the SGC batched GraphQL commit)
   failure must NOT be swallowed: a silently-swallowed batch failure reports the
   creator as a clean success with stash_ids lost.
