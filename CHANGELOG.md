# Changelog

<!-- markdownlint-configure-file { "MD024": { "siblings_only": true } } -->

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Prior history:** Releases before v0.13.0 are documented in [`ReleaseNotes.md`](https://github.com/Jakan-Kink/fansly-scraper/blob/main/ReleaseNotes.md) in the project's original prose-style format. The v0.13.0 entry is mirrored here in Keep-a-Changelog form and is the canonical structure for all subsequent releases.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.15.1] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Max-resolution cap (`filters.media.max_resolution`).** Cap downloads to a resolution tier (`240p`…`1440p`, `4k`) or a shorter-edge pixel integer: the highest rendition at or below the cap is downloaded (real downscaling when Fansly offers a smaller variant), and an item is skipped as a filtered download only when no rendition fits. Compares on the shorter edge so portrait and landscape both work; supports per-creator `by_creator` overrides and a `--max-resolution` CLI override (`off` disables per run); the authored form (`4k`/`1080p`) is preserved in config.yaml.

### Fixed

- **Batched account lookups no longer 404 — the wire format now matches the Fansly web client.** `GET /account?ids=` began rejecting the downloader's requests, killing the following-list flow at startup. The requests diverged from the browser on two axes: httpx's params-dict encoding sent `%2C` between ids where the browser sends literal commas, and a whole following page (up to 50 ids) went out as a single lookup where the browser chunks to 5 ids per request. `get_with_ngsw`/`get_with_ngsw_sync` now pre-encode the query string with commas left literal — covering every CSV endpoint (`account?ids=`, `account?usernames=`, `account/media?ids=`, `subscriptions?ids=`) — and the following-list and `wall_filters` account lookups go out in chunks of the new `options.account_ids_batch_size` (default 5, matching the browser; only written to `config.yaml` when explicitly set).

## [0.15.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- **Per-creator wall filters (`filters.wall`).** Wall mode previously downloaded every wall a creator has; now a creator → walls map restricts the run to specific wall(s), matched case-insensitively by the names shown as tabs on the creator page or by wall snowflake ID (visible in DevTools), with optional `includes`/`excludes` lists (excludes-only means "all walls except these"). The map defines the run's creator scope outright — `usernames` is not consulted, `-u` narrows to a subset of the filter keys, and any conflicting `download_mode` or `use_following` raises instead of silently mixing. Common YAML list/dict confusions (bare strings, dash-prefixed nesting, `include`/`exclude` singulars, null values) normalize leniently with a correct-syntax example in every error. Wall names are re-resolved against the live account response each run, so a renamed wall produces a warning listing the creator's actual walls rather than a silent miss. Ephemeral CLI form: `--wall-filters` with a JSON map (defines the creator set) or, with exactly one `-u` creator, a bare comma-separated list — never written back to `config.yaml`.
- **Media size/duration filters (`filters.media`) — #125.** For creators who post every stream VOD (or sub-second teasers) to their timeline: global `file_size_min`/`file_size_max`/`duration_min`/`duration_max` limits with per-creator `by_creator` overrides using field-level tri-state merge (an absent field inherits the global, an explicit `0`/`null` disables that limit for that creator; duplicate keys after `@`/case sanitization raise). Values are human-friendly — sizes via pydantic `ByteSize` (`100KB`, `4GB`, `1GiB`, raw bytes), durations via `pytimeparse2` (`90`, `1:30:00`, `45m`, `2h30m`). Enforcement is layered to spend the fewest possible bytes discovering a violation: a metadata gate (API-supplied duration, videos only, plus any size evidence recorded on a prior run), a bitrate x duration estimate gate for HLS VODs that prices the stream from the master playlist before fetching a single segment (degrading silently whenever it can't price), a content-length check at the wire for regular files, a running-byte-total abort inside the segment/PyAV download tiers, and a final-file truth check. Filtered media records `observedContentLength`/`estimatedContentLength`/`lastFilteredReason` into its `metadata` JSON but is never marked downloaded — loosening the limits later picks the items up normally. `--single` requests and live-stream captures are exempt. Per-run CLI overrides: `--file-size-min`/`--file-size-max`/`--duration-min`/`--duration-max` (a `0` disables that limit for the run; `by_creator` entries still win). Skipped items print as `Filtered [reason]` and tally in a new `Filtered by filters.media` statistics line.

### Changed

- **asyncpg constraint widened to `>=0.30.0,<0.32.0` (lock now 0.31.0), unblocking Python 3.14.** 0.30.0 has no cp314 wheels and never will, so 3.14 users were stuck building from source. The pin existed because 0.31.0 segfaulted under pytest (MagicStack/asyncpg#1292); the crash is now fully root-caused: it requires asyncpg to be *used, dropped from `sys.modules`, re-imported, and used again* — 0.31.0 (built with Cython >=3.2.1's per-module state) crashes in `BaseProtocol.__init__` on the NULL module state, while 0.30.0 survives the same sequence but silently splits its exception classes into two generations so `except asyncpg.X:` stops matching. The only in-repo trigger was coverage.py probe-importing dotted `--cov=pkg.module` sources and un-importing them; path-form `--cov` sources are now mandated (`docs/testing/TESTING_REQUIREMENTS.md`) and the full suite runs green on 0.31.0. Neither failure mode is reachable from normal app use — production never re-imports asyncpg.
- **Production code is now fully statically typed — mypy reports zero errors project-wide.** The API JSON ingestion boundary returns honest `JsonDict | list[JsonValue]` instead of `Any`, with new `expect_dict`/`expect_list`/`expect_int`/`str_or_none` narrowing helpers (`helpers/common.py`) forcing explicit fail-fast coercion of Fansly payload scalars; `get_store()` is typed `PostgresEntityStore`; stats shapes became TypedDicts; error and Stash-processing signatures carry concrete types. Requires `stash-graphql-client >=0.12.12` (its `TypeIs` guards narrow under a py3.12 mypy target).
- **Test suite: internal mocks removed in favor of real pipelines, per-test UUID databases collapsed into 37 class-shared stores, shallow tests parametrized/merged (~375 test functions removed), and the whole `tests/` tree brought under mypy.** Stash integration tests now SKIP (not ERROR) when the local Stash server is down, mirroring the PostgreSQL skip. Coverage held at 96.89% with a double full-suite gate identical at 2763 passed / 0 failed.

### Fixed

- **The daemon now holds its Stash context open for the daemon's lifetime.** Each incremental pass previously ran its own Stash cleanup, closing the shared singleton client out from under later passes; the open now happens once at daemon startup and the close only at shutdown, with passes connecting lazily when Stash is inactive or the initial connect fails.
- **Livestream recordings no longer abort on a chat-WS hiccup.** The chat-task drain at stream end is non-fatal, and a debug-only `assert` in that path became a real runtime check so optimized (`-O`) builds get the same protection.
- **Stash background-task failures are logged again.** `logger.exception` was given an f-string interpolating the exception repr; any repr containing braces hit loguru's `str.format` and raised `KeyError`, masking the original error. Now uses the `exc_info` form.
- **`get_project_version()` crashed with `KeyError` when falling back to reading `pyproject.toml` directly** — the tomllib fallback still read the pre-PEP-621 `[tool.poetry].version` location. It now reads `[project].version` first, keeping `[tool.poetry]` as the legacy fallback.
- **Latent shape bugs surfaced by the typing pass, fixed en route:** a group-id int/str mismatch in messages processing, dead `_handled` writes in the timeline/wall/messages loops, an invalid `Pool.join()` argument, a dead identity-map cache scan, missing `download_url` None-guards, a media-index leaf-collision owner-union, a preview-repair DB reconcile gap, and WS envelope decoding that raised `AttributeError` on non-object payloads (now degrades to an empty dict with id fields coerced through `expect_int`).

## [0.14.5] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- **File-first Stash sweep with scene-split adjudication** (`enable_scene_split`: false / dry-run / true). Replaces the code-index Stash lookup with a per-file sweep that adjudicates each downloaded file against Stash (own / split-into-new-scene / detect-and-log), so cross-source pHash collisions no longer clobber metadata.
- **Preview-handling repair** (`repair_previews`: false / dry-run / true). Backfills already-downloaded preview files — `preview_id_` marker, `Previews/` folder, `Media.local_filename` — with `normalize_filename` now preview-marker-correct; runs a blocking Stash rescan + cache-invalidation when Stash is active.
- **Subscription tracking** — `subscriptions`, `subscription_plans`, and `follow_events` tables and models — plus access-change-driven deduplication bypass.

### Changed

- **De-sprawl consolidation** across config / daemon / metadata / download / stash: DRY-ed timestamp and path logic, cut circular imports, removed dead code, and consolidated adjudication return paths. Large test-coverage expansion alongside.
- API endpoints exposed as `_ENDPOINT` ClassVars; respx tests standardized on the `try/finally` dump convention.

### Fixed

- Migration `3b51fe86b710` (the v0.14.4 FK-`CASCADE` restore) now deletes pre-existing orphan junction rows before recreating each constraint, so it applies on live databases that already carry orphans.
- Shutdown path optimized: httpx pool teardown, IVS segment handling, daemon countdown reset, and additional shutdown-hang diagnostics.
- Test and config robustness: caplog survival, plyvel context-manager mocking, livestream fake stream `.type`, and extra config validation.

## [0.14.4] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **TRACE logging regression from v0.14.0.** The `-v`/`-vv` overhaul deleted the sqlalchemy/websocket TRACE bridges and replaced them with a generic check only the `-vv` CLI flag set, so YAML `logging.global.trace: true` was ignored outside the trace sink and any handler with explicit `level: TRACE` was silently clamped to DEBUG. The original whitelist is restored: only `trace`, `sqlalchemy`, and `websocket` emit TRACE; `-vv` floors those three at TRACE (others cap at DEBUG); YAML `global.trace` and `-vv` now behave identically.
- **Chat-WS recording silently broken since v0.13.7.** Two compounding failures: the v0.13.7 subprocess-isolation split moved the WS surface to `_ChildWebSocket` but `_chat_ws_loop` kept calling the old `FanslyWebSocket` API, raising `TypeError` on its first iteration with the exception parked invisibly in the Task slot — zero chat captured, no logs until stream end; and the chat socket connected to `wsv3.fansly.com` instead of `chatws.fansly.com`, which accepts the `t=46001` join but never broadcasts `(46,10)` chat events. Now uses `_ChildWebSocket` with `base_url=CHAT_URL`, hard-stops after 5 consecutive pre-connect construction failures, and a done-callback surfaces chat-task exceptions at ERROR instead of letting them sit until stream end.
- **IVS livestream mux: High-profile recordings now play in strict decoders.** Output streams are created via `add_stream_from_template` so the MP4's `avcC` sample description carries the source's real SPS/PPS — `add_stream(codec, rate=...)` left it with libx264 defaults, which happened to work for Baseline/Main but broke High-profile streams (CABAC, B-frames, 16 ref frames) with "reference overflow / cabac_init_idc overflow" decode failures. The earlier EINVAL-on-every-packet that originally forced the explicit-`add_stream` approach was actually caused by an unrelated `time_base` override, now dropped.
- Mux `output.close()` exceptions are now logged instead of suppressed — "output missing or empty" failures previously left no traceback. Empty stale log files no longer rotate at init and consume backup slots.
- **Interpreter shutdown no longer hangs ~30s after cleanup completes.** `multiprocessing` queue feeder threads (`cancel_join_thread` on both parent and child side of the WS subprocess pipes), the websockets close handshake (bounded to 2s), and loguru sink draining (`logger.complete()` bounded to 2s) were each blocking process exit; atexit registration of the DB cleanup is deduplicated, and `config/browser.py` uses `plyvel.DB` as a context manager so a failed open can't leak a handle into `__del__` at shutdown.
- Latent circular import between `config/fanslyconfig.py` and `api` broke unpickling in spawn-start subprocesses; the import is now `TYPE_CHECKING`-gated.
- **#109** — `ForeignKeyViolationError` on every run once a creator removed a wall whose posts were already archived. `process_account_walls` deletes walls no longer present in the API response, but the SQLite-era `merge_recent_migrations` revision had recreated the `wall_posts` foreign keys without the `ON DELETE CASCADE` the original constraints carried, so the wall delete was rejected while `wall_posts` rows still referenced it. New migration `3b51fe86b710` restores `CASCADE` on both `wall_posts` FKs and on `media_locations.mediaId` (stripped by the same revision), and `metadata/tables.py` now declares the same so fresh databases match. Deleting a wall removes only its junction rows — the posts themselves are untouched.

### Changed

- **Version number now has a single source of truth: `pyproject.toml` `[project].version`.** `fansly_downloader_ng.__version__` is resolved at startup (installed package metadata when available, otherwise `tomllib` read of the adjacent `pyproject.toml`), instead of a hand-maintained constant that had to be bumped in lockstep. Bumping is now one command (`poetry version patch` / `minor` / `major`), and the release workflow fails early if a pushed tag doesn't match the pyproject version.
- `api/websocket.py` migrated from the legacy `websockets` client API to `websockets.asyncio.client`, with `user_agent_header=` and `ssl=` applied only for `wss://` URLs.
- `(5,22)` typing announcements are dropped at the WS layer (`SILENT_SERVICE_EVENTS` in `api/websocket_protocol.py`) — neither logged nor dispatched, instead of being logged as no-op events.
- `EXT-X-ENDLIST` in a livestream manifest is treated as terminal: recording finalizes immediately and the reconnect-grace machinery is removed.
- `--stash-only` with YAML `daemon_mode: true` now silently disables the daemon for that run; the explicitly contradictory `--stash-only --daemon` raises a config error.

### Added

- Livestream + WS test infrastructure: a scripted-responder Fansly WS test server fixture (`tests/fixtures/api/fansly_ws_test_server.py`) with canonical payload builders, and IVS livestream factories/fixtures (sliding-window manifest scenarios, PyAV leaf-fakes) backing new end-to-end chat and recorder integration tests.
- `docs/reference/Fansly-WebSocket-Protocol.md` substantially expanded: ack semantics, `(9,2)` gathering events, order-type discriminator, `n*1000+k` service convention, svc=58, wire-order races, per-recipient ack directionality.

## [0.14.3] - 2026-05-14

Post-launch cleanup of the per-handler logging schema introduced yesterday in v0.14.0. Several values the schema accepted weren't reachable from production (and vice versa) — operators using a value that one side accepted but the other didn't were hitting validation errors or runtime crashes. Plus config-load validators catching operator typos.

### Fixed

- `logging.<entry>.rotation_when`: schema and production now agree on `s/m/h/d/w`. `w` (weekly) reachable from YAML for the first time; `midnight` (which crashed at handler construction) rejected at YAML load.
- `logging.<entry>.compression`: schema and production now agree on `gz/bz2/xz`, all three implemented for real via stdlib `gzip` / `bz2` / `lzma`. `bz2` and `xz` were YAML-accepted but crashed at rotation; `7z` and `lzha` were handler-accepted but broken (`shutil.make_archive` has no `7z`; `lzha` silently made `.zip`).

### Added

- `targeted_creator.usernames`: validator enforces Fansly's client-side rules (length 4-20, charset `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`). Operator typos surface at YAML load instead of at runtime.
- Logging int fields tolerate thousand-separator commas (`max_size: 209,715,200`).

### Removed

- `logging.<entry>.format` and `logging.global.default_format` (both introduced yesterday in v0.14.0). Format strings are now source-only; the console handler's default is a callable that a YAML string override would silently degrade.

## [0.14.2] - 2026-05-13

Patch release completing the #94 scope-respect coverage that v0.14.0 only partially addressed.

### Fixed

- `daemon.runner._handle_work_item` now hoists the creator-scope check to the dispatch point. v0.14.0's inline checks only covered `_handle_messages_item` and `_handle_full_creator_item`; the other five `_WORK_DISPATCH` handlers (`RedownloadCreatorMedia`, `CheckCreatorAccess`, `DownloadStoriesOnly`, `DownloadTimelineOnly`, `MarkMessagesDeleted`) ran unfiltered. WS events captured via `bootstrap_daemon_ws` during batch-mode initial sync drained through those unfiltered handlers, causing downloads from creators outside the operator's `-u` / `targeted_creator.usernames` whitelist even with `daemon_mode: false`.
- `daemon.livestream_watcher._poll_and_diff` now filters live creators against `config.is_username_in_scope` before spawning recording tasks. Pre-fix the watcher recorded every followed creator currently live regardless of the operator's whitelist.
- `FanslyConfig.monitoring_livestream_recording_enabled` dataclass default flipped `True` → `False` to match the v0.14.0 schema-side flip. Schema→config sync overwrites this in normal YAML loads, so the mismatch only bled through in tests and programmatic `FanslyConfig()` construction.

### Changed

- Scope predicate hoisted to `FanslyConfig.is_username_in_scope(str | None)`. Synchronous, type-validated, no metadata-store touch. Callers that already hold a username (livestream watcher, payload-driven entry points) use it directly. The id-based `daemon.runner._is_creator_in_scope` is now a thin shim that resolves id → username via the local Account store, then delegates — kept permanently since WS events only carry account ids.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-05-13

Patch release for a render-policy regression in v0.14.0's nested `LoggingSection` schema.

### Fixed

- `_section_to_map` now applies the "set OR `_ALWAYS`" render rule at every nesting level, not just the top section. v0.14.0 inlined nested Pydantic submodels via `model_dump()` recursively, dumping every inner field including unset conditional ones as `None`; ruamel.yaml wrote each `None` as a bare `key:` line. Symptom: an enabled `trace` handler produced `format:` / `max_size:` / `rotation_when:` / etc. with no values, alongside the real `enabled`/`filename`/`level` lines. Fresh scaffolds are unaffected.

### Notes

If your v0.14.0 `config.yaml` already shows bare-key lines under any logging handler entry (`format:` with no value, `max_size:` with no value, etc.), delete them once by hand. Pydantic's loader treats an explicit `field: null` as "operator set this", so the next save preserves the bare keys rather than self-cleaning. The manual edit is a one-time fix.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-05-13

Verbosity refactor (`--debug` → `-v`/`-vv` with broader trace semantic), config-driven logging schema, daemon scope fixes (#94), and tag-triggered auto-release workflow.

### Added

- Config-driven `LoggingSection`: eight named loggers (two console + six file) under `logging:`, each with `enabled`/`level`/`format` plus orthogonal size and time rotation axes. Per-handler `None` falls through to `logging.global.default_*`. Pre-v0.14 flat shape (`logging: {sqlalchemy: INFO, textio: INFO, ...}`) auto-migrates to the nested form via a `model_validator(mode="before")`.
- `-v` / `-vv` CLI flags (`action="count"`). `-v` floors every handler at DEBUG; `-vv` floors every handler at TRACE and opens the `trace.log` sink. Per-run only; never written back to `config.yaml`.
- Daemon simulator state transitions now emit cause-tagged log lines: `daemon.runner: activity state -> active (new_content/<source>)` from the home-timeline + story polling loops, and `... -> active (ws_interrupt svc=N type=M)` on WS-bus wake from hidden state.
- `.github/workflows/release-on-tag.yml` — GitHub Action that creates a Release from the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section on `v<digit>...` tag push. PEP 440 (`v0.14.0`, `v0.14.0b1`, `v0.14.0.dev1`) + SemVer (`v0.14.0-rc1`) shapes both supported; alpha/beta/rc/dev flagged as pre-release, `.postN` stays stable.

### Changed

- Trace mode runtime semantic broadened. `-vv` and persistent `logging.global.trace=true` now floor **every** handler at TRACE, not just `trace_logger`/`sqlalchemy`/`websocket` as before. `setup_handlers` operates on a `LoggingSection.model_copy(deep=True)` so the runtime override doesn't leak back into `_config.logging` and silently persist into YAML on the next `_save_config`.
- `monitoring.livestream_recording_enabled` default flipped `true` → `false`. The feature was previously on by default without docs (#94).
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/report-a-bug.md` rebranded for the Jakan-Kink fork: links point to `Jakan-Kink/fansly-scraper`, version example bumped to v0.13.7, "config.ini options" reference replaced with `config.yaml` + `docs/configuration/config_options.md`.
- `docs/configuration/config_options.md` audited: CLI ↔ config mapping table rewritten (~30 real flags; the prior table listed `-dm`, `-p`, and `--metadata-only` entries that are no longer present in `argparse` — these were removed from the table). Retired-field callouts added under every affected section. `-r` / `--reverse-order` description corrected to "reverse alphabetical creator order" — the flag controls `sorted(user_names, ...)`, not timeline chronology.

### Fixed

- Daemon WS handlers now honor the `-u` scope filter on message and full-creator items, matching the behavior story polling already had. Foreign-creator events (a message from a creator outside the `-u` set, a WS subscription event for an unrelated account) are skipped instead of triggering scrapes (#94).
- `tests/api/unit/test_websocket.py::test_ping_timeout_resets_connection` setup ordering: `_last_ping_response = 0.0` now runs **after** `_start_ping_loop()`, so the production's loop-start reset doesn't clobber the stale-value setup. Fixes intermittent failure under `-n8`.

### Removed

- `--debug` CLI flag. Use `-v` (DEBUG floor on every handler) or `-vv` (TRACE floor on every handler) instead.
- Schema fields `options.debug`, `options.trace`, `logging.global.debug`. Legacy `config.yaml` files carrying any of these load cleanly — the retired-field validator (`_DROPPED_FIELDS`) strips them before `extra="forbid"` runs. Operators wanting persistent verbosity should edit `logging.global.default_level` (per-handler default) instead.

## [0.13.7] - 2026-05-12

WebSocket gateway refactor, livestream/daemon hardening, and production fixes surfaced by the tests-to-100 fixture migration.

### Added

- WebSocket event classification: known no-op events (e.g. service=1,2 post-like broadcasts) now identify concretely in trace logs instead of being labeled "unknown event".
- H.264 High-profile mux path for IVS livestream recordings; `daemon/livestream_watcher.py` split from the parent module.

### Changed

- WebSocket subsystem collapsed: subprocess `FanslyWebSocket` is the single production class — the threading variant and the separate gateway layer have been folded in.
- `cors_options_request` in `get_with_ngsw` / `get_with_ngsw_sync` is gated on `add_fansly_headers`. CDN downloads (which pass `add_fansly_headers=False`) no longer fire OPTIONS preflight — saves one round-trip per file and removes an anti-detection fingerprint real browsers don't produce on CORS-simple GETs.
- Gallery image linking switched to `Gallery.__side_mutations__["images"]` (SGC v0.12+) via direct `gallery.images = ...` assignment — one batched `addGalleryImages` per gallery save instead of N `imageUpdate(gallery_ids=...)` calls.
- WS ping/pong pairs removed from trace logs (2 events per 20s saturated slow-period logs).
- Daemon simulator no longer pins to the active state; home-feed limbo state fixed.
- `_resolve_variant_url` (livestream) made async; was previously blocking.

### Fixed

- Config schema validation issue.
- IVS muxing issues and logging-level mismatches in livestream recording.
- Stale `gallery_ids` re-submission via `imageUpdate` causing intermittent ~18% flake on stash gallery integration tests; the new gallery-side relationship path (see Changed) avoids re-submitting the image's full `gallery_ids` list and so the FK validation can't fail on cleaned-up gallery refs.

### Dependencies

- Pin `asyncpg<0.31` (downgrade 0.31.0 → 0.30.0). asyncpg 0.31.0 has a Cython teardown SIGSEGV regression on Python 3.13 under high-worker pytest configurations. Add asyncpg-stubs 0.30.2 for typing coverage.
- Poetry deps refresh.

## [0.13.6] - 2026-05-09

Livestream recorder overwrite-protection on broadcast reconnects.

### Added

- `_unique_output_path` helper in `daemon/livestream_watcher.py`: when a broadcast reconnect would produce the same output filename as a previously completed (or crash-interrupted) session, the new recording is written to `<stem>_part2.mp4`, `_part3.mp4`, etc. A slot is considered taken when the MP4 already exists with data **or** when its temp segment dir is still on disk from a prior crashed attempt.

### Fixed

- Livestream recorder silently overwrote the previous session's completed MP4 whenever a creator reconnected mid-broadcast. `_record_stream` now calls `_unique_output_path` before creating the temp segment dir, ensuring each reconnect session gets a distinct output file.

## [0.13.5] - 2026-05-09

Async API migration, YAML config render-policy, interactive prompt refactor, rate-limiter hardening, atomic downloads, URL centralization, livestream recording, and logging sink fix.

### Added

- `daemon/livestream_watcher.py` — long-running watcher task that polls `GET /api/v1/streaming/followingstreams/online` and spawns a per-creator recording task for every followed creator who is live.
- IVS HLS recording via manual segment polling (`httpx` + `m3u8`): dedup by `EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE` index, `EXT-X-PREFETCH` leading-edge hint collection, and a 60 s `EXT-X-ENDLIST` grace period for transient creator pauses.
- PID-based PyAV mux (`_mux_ivs_segments`): probes up to 5 segments to identify stable audio/video PIDs, PTS-rebases packets across segment boundaries, and writes a single MP4.
- Orphan-segment salvage (`_salvage_orphan_segments`): on watcher startup, re-muxes `.<stem>_segments` temp dirs left behind by a prior crash.
- Three new `MonitoringSection` config fields: `livestream_recording_enabled`, `livestream_poll_interval_seconds` (default 30), `livestream_manifest_poll_interval_seconds` (default 3, range 1–15).
- Six new Fansly API endpoints: `get_following_streams_online`, `get_streaming_channel`, `get_chatroom_messages`, `get_chatrooms`, `get_chatrooms_settings`, `post_chatroom_subalert`.
- `StreamSession`, `StreamChannel`, `StreamingInfo` Pydantic models in `metadata/models.py` for ephemeral livestream API payloads.
- `textio/prompts.py` — new module centralizing all interactive user prompts; all call sites migrated from inline `input()`/`ainput()` to the new helpers.
- `FanslyApi.BASE_URL`, `FANSLY_HOST`, `WS_URL` class variables and 16 endpoint `@property` templates centralizing every Fansly URL in one place.
- `--show-config` and `--generate-config` CLI flags.
- `config_schema` render-policy markers (`always` / `conditional`) so generated scaffold configs include only operator-required fields.
- `respect_timeline_stats` config field; nullable `usernames` field.
- `cascade-up` semantics for section serialization in the YAML loader.
- `tests/fixtures/config/config_fixtures.py`: `unit_config`, `unit_config_path`, `no_display`, `validation_config` fixtures (distinct from the DB-backed `config`).
- `tests/fixtures/download/story_factories.py`: `FakeStory` factory.
- Rate limiter: asyncio.gather concurrency tests covering `floor=0` and `floor>0` serialization invariants.

### Changed

- All `FanslyApi` HTTP methods migrated to `async`/`httpx.AsyncClient`; the entire download pipeline is now fully async end-to-end.
- `RateLimiterDisplay.start()` moved from `get_api()` to `setup_api()` so the cached constructor remains I/O-free.
- `textio/prompts.py` consolidates all prompts; `textio/textio.py` and call sites simplified accordingly.
- YAML loader refactored to preserve `model_fields_set` honesty and fix the `_rebuild_schema_from_config` round-trip (mutates sections in place instead of reconstructing them).
- `config/fanslyconfig.py` section-model decomposition aligned with new render-policy schema.
- Regular downloads stream into a sibling `NamedTemporaryFile` and atomically `shutil.move` to the target path — partial files no longer reach the dedup hash store on interrupted downloads.
- Unbound `logger.*` calls (no `.bind(logger=...)`) now route to the textio console and file handlers instead of being silently dropped by all filters.
- `api/websocket.py` `http_client` typed to accept `httpx.AsyncClient` in production and `httpx.Client` on the legacy test path.
- `daemon/filters.py` `should_process_creator` ported to async.

### Fixed

- Rate limiter Bug A residual: `_reserve_slot` cursor stalled at `learned_floor=0` on cold start. Now advances by `max(floor, token_refill_interval)` so concurrent waiters serialise even before the floor warms up.
- Rate limiter: removed redundant `last_backoff_time` double-write in the success-reduction branch that was staling the cursor clamp.
- Config INI loader: `model_fields_set` honesty preserved during migration so fields touched only by defaults are not written to the output YAML.
- `_rebuild_schema_from_config` round-trip: sections are now mutated in place rather than reconstructed wholesale, fixing field-ordering regressions.
- Logging grapheme-cluster collapse for supplementary-plane emoji and VS16-modified codepoints that misaligned Rich column widths over SSH/tmux.

## [0.13.4] - 2026-05-08

Stash integration enhancements for non-aligned library layouts and separate-host workflows, a streaming-response error-handling fix, and test-suite housekeeping that retires unused packaging dependencies.

### Added

- `stash_context.override_dldir_w_mapped` config field. When `true`, `get_stash_path()` returns `mapped_path` directly and ignores the per-creator subfolder structure — path filters scope to the entire fansly-managed area in Stash. Targets users who copy scraper downloads to a separate Stash host and reorganise the files into a different folder structure (e.g. split by media type into `Videos/<studio>/` and `Photos/<studio>/`), so the per-creator subfolder name the scraper expects (`<creator>_fansly/`) never appears in any Stash file path. Pydantic validator rejects the flag at config load when `mapped_path` is unset.
- `stash_context.require_stash_only_mode` config field. When `true`, Stash integration only engages on `--stash-only` runs; regular download modes (NORMAL, TIMELINE, MESSAGES, WALL, SINGLE, STORIES, COLLECTION) skip every Stash code path even when `stash_context` is populated. Workflow: scrape locally, copy files to the Stash host manually, then run `--stash-only` to attribute metadata.
- `FanslyConfig.stash_active` property — single decision point for "should Stash run this iteration." Replaces the bare `stash_context_conn is not None` check at the post-download StashProcessing call site.
- Three-tier anchor in `_create_targeted_regex_pattern`: per-creator `base_path` (default), `mapped_path` (when scoped=False with mapping set), or code-only (no mapping). The lazy per-batch fallback now scopes regex queries to `mapped_path.*(codes)` instead of going library-wide when mapping is configured.
- `prompt-toolkit` runtime dependency. The interactive download-directory prompt in `pathio` now offers tab-completion, `~`-expansion, and inline path validation.

### Changed

- `_section_to_map` (YAML save) now uses `model_dump(by_alias=True)` with an alias-to-attribute lookup so aliased fields write their YAML key on save instead of the Python attribute name. Previously `LoggingSection.json_level` was dumped as `json_level: ...` which the loader rejected on next start (`extra_forbidden`) — config files written by 0.13.3 would fail to reload.
- `LoggingSection` gained a `mode="before"` validator that remaps legacy `json_level:` keys to the canonical `json:` alias before the `extra="forbid"` rejection fires, so configs broken by the prior save bug keep loading.
- `get_stash_path()` resolution ladder: override + mapped_path → `str(mapped_path)`; mapped_path only → prefix substitution (existing 0.13.3 behaviour); neither → unchanged local path.
- Stash file indexers (`_index_scene_files` / `_index_image_files`) now use `fileio.normalize.get_id_from_filename` for media-ID and preview-ID extraction instead of hand-rolled `_id_` / `_preview_id_` parsing. Single regex pass; `is_preview` is now available as a side-channel signal for downstream tagging work.

### Fixed

- Every non-200 download response was raising `httpx.ResponseNotRead` instead of the intended `DownloadError`. `_download_file` and `_download_regular_file` request `stream=True` from `get_with_ngsw`, then on the non-200 branch tried to format an error with `response.content.decode('utf-8')` — httpx forbids reading `.content` on a streaming response without a prior `.read()`. Fixed to call `response.read().decode("utf-8", errors="replace")` first, so the actual server status and body now surface in error logs for failed downloads.
- `mapped_path` resolution edge case in the by-code regex fallback.

### Removed

- `pyinstaller` dev dependency. The packaging build was abandoned upstream and the dead-test audit flagged the harness code as untested-and-unreachable.
- `psutil` test dependency (typing stub `types-psutil` retained for type-checking).

## [0.13.3] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- `stash_context.mapped_path` config field: translates the local `download_directory` prefix to the path the Stash container sees, enabling the Stash integration for Docker / NFS setups where mount point prefixes differ between the scraper environment and the Stash server. Set to the Stash-side root (e.g. `/data/fansly`) and leave `download_directory` as the local path. All three Stash path operations (metadata scan, `path__contains` preload filter, and targeted regex fallback) now go through a new `get_stash_path()` helper in `pathio`.

### Removed

- `--stash-scheme`, `--stash-host`, `--stash-port`, `--stash-apikey` CLI flags. These were silently broken (the application code was accidentally placed inside a docstring in `check_attributes()` and never executed). Stash connection settings are config-file only; `--stash-only` (a mode flag, not a connection setting) is retained.

### Added

- WebSocket transport now runs on its own dedicated thread with a private asyncio loop (`FanslyWebSocket.start_in_thread()` / `stop_thread()`). Inbound service events are marshalled back to the main loop so handler- side state (EntityStore, StashClient, asyncpg pool) stays single- threaded.
- New `_handle_wallet_transaction` daemon handler observes Fansly `svc=6 type=3` wallet transaction events (subscription/PPV payments) and logs them at INFO so file-availability changes leave a trail.
- `_configure_warnings_capture()` wires `logging.captureWarnings(True)` and routes `py.warnings` records through loguru, so warnings emitted via `warnings.warn()` (notably `stash-graphql-client`'s `StashUnmappedFieldWarning`) now reach the rich console and every log-file sink instead of bypassing them to raw stderr.
- `InterceptHandler.emit` now routes by `record.name`: SQLAlchemy / asyncpg / Alembic records to the db sink, `stash_graphql_client.*` to the stash sink, and `py.warnings` records routed by origin file path.

### Changed

- **Eliminated WebSocket reconnect death-spiral.** The ping_worker previously shared the main asyncio loop with downloads, GraphQL processing, and polling; under load the loop drifted > 5s, the worker woke late and misdiagnosed its own scheduling lag as a Fansly server keepalive failure, tearing down a healthy connection roughly every 30 seconds. Moving the WebSocket transport to its own thread with a private loop fixes the root cause (the ping timeout itself is spec'd from Fansly's `main.js` as `1.2 * pingInterval` and cannot be loosened without diverging from protocol behavior).
- **CLI flags no longer silently rewrite `config.yaml`.** Every flagged field (`--stash-only`, `--normal`, `--messages`, `--timeline`, `--collection`, `--single`, `--debug`, `-uf` / `-ufp`, `-u`, the nine negative-bool flags, the three positive-bool flags) is now marked as an _ephemeral override_ and cannot leak into the on-disk YAML. In particular, `--debug` no longer clobbers `debug: true` in YAML on every invocation that omits the flag, and `-u creator1,creator2` no longer overwrites a curated `user_names` list with the daemon's auto-fetched following list.
- **Narrowed daemon over-eager following refresh.** `_worker_loop` now only triggers `_refresh_following` on `FullCreatorDownload` (confirmed subscription WS events), not on `DownloadTimelineOnly`. The `/timeline/home` poll's creators are already in the following set by construction, so the prior per-poll-hit refresh fanned out to ~30 account fetches per new post.
- YAML's `session_baseline` is now consume-and-reset: loaded once into the runtime field, then cleared and persisted as `null`. Self-heals YAMLs left in permanent-full-pass state by a prior schema-write bug.
- Hash-computation calls in `download/media.py` (post-download and mid-download checks, 4 sites) now run via `asyncio.to_thread` so they no longer block the main download loop.
- Bumped `stash-graphql-client` floor from `>=0.12.0` to `>=0.12.2`. `stash/processing/base.py` imports and catches `StashCapabilityError`, which only exists in SGC ≥ 0.12.2; the older floor allowed installs to resolve to a version missing that symbol.

### Performance

- **30-creator daemon pass: ~70 min → ~12 min (6× speedup); peak RSS: 9 GB → ~2.4 GB.** Cumulative effect of the entries below.
- FanslyObject `_snapshot` now uses `PrivateAttr(default=None)` with initialization in `model_post_init`, rather than `default_factory=dict`. Pydantic 2.13's `init_private_attributes` calls `inspect.signature` on every `default_factory` per instance to decide whether the factory takes a validated-data argument; for C-implemented built-ins (`dict`) that lookup falls into `inspect._signature_fromstr` (~50 KB allocation per call, not cached upstream). At identity-map preload scale (~682K FanslyObject constructions across all model types) this dominated per-instance cost. Mirrors `stash-graphql-client@c701c4606` (the upstream sibling fix that ships for SGC-side entities).
- 18 mutable list field defaults converted from `= []` to `Field(default_factory=list)`. Pydantic 2 deep-copies mutable field defaults per instance to prevent shared state; `Field(default_factory=list)` calls the factory directly without going through `copy.deepcopy`. Eliminates ~106 MB of allocator churn (memo dicts, `_keep_alive` table, dispatch walks) per startup preload — confirmed by memray attribution dropping from 119 MB to 13 MB through the `copy.py` subtree.
- `PostgresEntityStore._type_index: dict[type, set[int]]` secondary index. Per-type iteration paths (`filter`, `find` cache-first, `find_one`, `count`, `find_iter`, `invalidate_type`, `cache_stats`) now run in O(this type) instead of O(`_cache`). Mirrors MMsD `postgres_entity_store.py:333` / SGC `store.py` `_type_index`. Maintained alongside `_cache` in `cache_instance` / `invalidate*`.
- Monotonic-clock TTL with per-type override: `PostgresEntityStore(default_ttl=...)` constructor argument and `store.set_ttl(model_type, ttl)` per-type setter. `_is_expired` uses `time.monotonic()` (immune to wall-clock changes). Daemon poll cadences span 30s (stories) to 10min (FYP), so per-type granularity matters; `get_from_cache` evicts and returns `None` once an entry's TTL has elapsed.
- `cache_stats()` rewritten to walk `_type_index` (O(types)) instead of scanning `_cache` (O(N)); now also exposes the existing `_stats` hit/miss counters in the same payload.
- Singular `belongs_to` relationships go tri-state — `UNSET` / `None` / object — using SGC's `UnsetType` sentinel imported from `stash_graphql_client.types.unset`. `__setattr__` distinguishes the three states; cache hits link the relationship, cache misses leave `UNSET` so consumers use `is_set()` to distinguish "not yet loaded" from "explicitly cleared". `_autolink_relationships(obj)` runs after `model_validate` to resolve `UNSET` → cached object after DB-load, preventing `to_db_dict`'s FK-derivation loop from clobbering FK columns to NULL.
- Stash creator-media indexes (`_scene_code_index`, `_image_code_index`) now store entity IDs rather than full Pydantic refs. Storing full objects pinned them past `invalidate_type`, so the per-creator heap drop was deferred to end-of-stash. `find_*_by_media_codes` rehydrates via `store.get_many` (cache-first, batched DB-fetch for misses).
- Per-creator stash invalidation list extended to include `VideoFile` and `ImageFile` leaves. `Scene`/`Image` preload via the GraphQL fragment caches the file-leaf children as separate identity-map entries; orphaning them across creators leaked ~3.9k objects per pass on a typical fan with ~3k images and ~800 scenes.

### Fixed

- **`StashUnmappedFieldWarning` and other `warnings.warn()` output now reach loguru sinks.** Two compound failures: `logger.patch()` was treated as in-place but actually returns a new logger (so `extra["logger"]` was never bound on stdlib-routed records, and every sink's `record.extra.logger == "<name>"` filter rejected them), and `logging.captureWarnings(True)` was never called (so `warnings.warn()` never entered the stdlib logging path at all). Together, SGC's `StashUnmappedFieldWarning` and any other library's `warnings.warn()` output bypassed the rich console + log files entirely.
- `InterceptHandler.emit` and `SQLAlchemyInterceptHandler.emit` previously fell back to `level = str(record.levelno)` on unknown level names; that string re-raised inside loguru's `.log()` because numeric strings are not registered level names. Pass the int through directly — loguru accepts ints natively.
- `config/logging.py`'s console formatter now escapes `<` in record messages in addition to `{`/`}`, so traceback frame names like `<module>`, `<listcomp>`, and `<genexpr>` no longer crash loguru's colorizer with `ValueError: Tag "<module>" does not correspond to any known color directive`. Loguru re-parses callable formatter output to strip tags even when `colorize=False`, so the escape is required regardless of sink color setting.
- `stash/processing/base.py` now catches `StashCapabilityError` distinct from `StashVersionError`, so per-feature appSchema gate failures surface as a clean error message rather than the bare exception that was leaking out of `get_client()`. Also broadens an over-narrow `except RuntimeError` (line 346): `stash_graphql_client.metadata_scan` raises `ValueError` on transport errors, which previously escaped uncaught.
- `_shutdown_js_bridge` (`helpers/checkkey.py`) previously only called `connection.stop()`, which terminates the Node subprocess but leaves several JSPyBridge Python daemon threads (`com_thread`, `stdout_thread`, `EventLoop.callbackExecutor`, per-task threads) blocking on `stream.readline()` / `queue.get()` until each individually polls and notices the subprocess died. Now joins all of them explicitly.
- Three daemon worker-loop bugs surfaced and fixed during test reform: `_handle_full_creator_download` was calling `download_wall(config, state)` without the required `wall_id`, `_refresh_following` was missing `get_creator_account_info`, and `_handle_timeline_only_item` was passing an empty `creator_name=""` downstream.
- xdist worker shutdown no longer raises `SIGABRT` / `SIGSEGV` / `SIGBUS`. Root cause was daemon threads (Rich Live refresh, loguru handler workers, httpx connection pool teardown) racing against `_Py_Finalize.flush_std_files` mid-buffered-write. Fixed by setting `TESTING=1` before any project import (forces synchronous loguru sinks), enabling `faulthandler.enable(all_threads=True)` for future diagnostics, plus per-test cleanup discipline (autouse fixtures that reset Rich/loguru/httpx state after every test) and an `atexit` backstop in `helpers/rich_progress.py`.
- Stash GraphQL test responses aligned with SGC 0.12's numeric-string / UUID4 ID validator and the new `StashEntityStore.populate()` filter- query resolution hop that fires before mutations.

### Removed

- `FanslyWebSocket.start_background()` / `stop()` / `_background_task` — replaced by the thread-based lifecycle (`start_in_thread()` / `stop_thread()`). Migrated all in-tree callers (`api/fansly.py`, `daemon/runner.py`, `scripts/websocket_example.py`); no deprecation period.
- `--updated-to` CLI flag and the corresponding `FanslyConfig` field. The self-update feature was removed upstream and the field had zero readers.
- `tests/daemon/conftest.py` — only `tests/conftest.py` is permitted per the project rule. The three fixtures it housed (`fake_ws`, `saved_account`, `config_wired`) migrated to `tests/fixtures/`.

### Internal

- Test-suite reform: every internal mock removed in favor of real fixtures, factories, and `store.add()` / `store.save()` preloads. Edges remain mocked via `respx` (Fansly HTTP, Stash GraphQL via the `httpx` transport) and external-library leaf calls (`imagehash`, `hashlib`, ffmpeg subprocess). Total project coverage rose to ~97.5% with `config/logging.py` at 100%, `api/websocket.py` at 99.06%, and new daemon test modules covering bootstrap, runner handlers, and runner loops end-to-end.
- New `--dist=loadgroup` pytest configuration plus an `xdist_group(name)` marker. Tests pinned to the same group share an xdist worker so their fragile shared state (notably the `message_media_generator` fixture's find-or-create race against a shared Docker Stash) doesn't deadlock across workers.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-04-23

Patch release fixing two issues reported on Windows + Python 3.14, plus rolling up incidental `fork-main` commits since v0.13.0.

### Added

- `docs/reference/request-signing.md` — reverse-engineered notes on Fansly's request-signing scheme.

### Changed

- **Dependency**: added `filelock ^3.29.0` as a direct runtime dep, replacing POSIX-only `fcntl` usage in the `config.ini → config.yaml` migration lock (see #77). filelock picks the right platform primitive automatically (`fcntl.flock` on POSIX, `msvcrt.locking` on Windows).
- `poetry.lock` and pre-commit hook versions refreshed.

### Fixed

- **#77** — Unconditional `import fcntl` at `config/loader.py:28` crashed app startup on Windows (fcntl is POSIX-only). Swapped to [filelock](https://github.com/tox-dev/filelock) with identical non-blocking semantics. Bonus: filelock cleans up stale `config.ini.migrating.lock` files on release (safe — unlink happens while the lock is still held, no TOCTOU).
- **#78** — Fansly returns `locations=[{"location": null, "locationId": 1}]` for some media (Direct slots with no CDN path resolved yet), which the required-str typing on `MediaLocation.location` rejected with 8 Pydantic validation errors per affected `Media`. Relaxed the field to `str | None` and the DB column to NULL-tolerant (Alembic migration `bb7006ec7c0e_make_media_locations_location_nullable`). Downstream readers at `media/media.py:27` already handled `None` via the `loc.raw_url or loc.location` fallback.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-04-22

First release under the Keep-a-Changelog format. Flagship feature: the post-batch monitoring daemon. Also rolls up every notable change landed since v0.11.0 shipped (a "v0.12" line was never cut as a distinct release).

### Added

- **Post-batch monitoring daemon** (`--daemon` / `-d` / `--monitor`) — continuous WebSocket-driven event dispatch for new posts, stories, PPV messages, message edits/deletes, subscription changes, and profile updates. Decoded `ServiceEvent` dicts are translated into typed `WorkItem`s (`DownloadTimelineOnly`, `DownloadStoriesOnly`, `DownloadMessagesForGroup`, `FullCreatorDownload`, `CheckCreatorAccess`, `RedownloadCreatorMedia`)
- **`ActivitySimulator`** — three-tier state machine (active → idle → hidden) calibrated from real browser-session profiling drives the daemon's polling cadence
- Timeline + story polling fallback for when the WebSocket is quiet; timeline-first-page probe short-circuits inactive creators (`lastCheckedAt` vs `post.createdAt`)
- Persistent `MonitorState` table — daemon restarts don't re-trigger every story or cold-scan every timeline
- Live Rich dashboard with per-creator state, WS health, queued work, and simulator phase
- Single shared `FanslyWebSocket` instance for both batch-sync and the daemon loop, with bidirectional cookie sync
- Clean SIGINT drain — `Ctrl-C` stops the queue and tears down the WS connection without dropping in-flight work
- **YAML configuration** (`config.yaml`) — new primary config format; legacy `config.ini` files auto-migrate on first run and are backed up as `config.ini.bak.<timestamp>`. Comments in user-edited YAML are preserved across load → modify → save cycles via `ruamel.yaml`
- `config.sample.yaml` template
- New `[monitoring]` config section for activity-simulator phase durations and per-phase polling intervals
- **New documentation**:
    - [Architecture](reference/architecture.md) — canonical public architecture reference
    - [Monitoring Daemon Cadence](reference/monitoring-cadence.md) — polling intervals + anti-detection rationale
    - [Monitoring Daemon Architecture](planning/monitoring-daemon-architecture.md) — full daemon design document (intervals, endpoints, behaviors verified against production `main.js`)
    - [Fansly WebSocket Protocol](reference/Fansly-WebSocket-Protocol.md) — WS protocol breakdown: service IDs, message types, price encoding (mills ÷ 1000), dual endpoints
    - [Manual Token Extraction](guide/manual-token-extraction.md) — fallback browser-token extraction guide (salvaged from prof79 wiki)
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) — new Keep-a-Changelog format going forward
- MkDocs + readthedocs-themed docs site with GHA deploy workflow to `gh-pages`
- Daemon dispatch: explicit no-op handler pattern (`_handle_noop_events` + `_NOOP_DESCRIPTIONS` in `daemon/handlers.py`) distinguishes "known event, deliberately ignored" from "unknown event, coverage gap" in logs.
- `daemon.handlers.has_handler(svc, type)` helper exposed for callers that need to differentiate handled-returned-None from no-handler-registered.
- `download/messages.py::download_messages_for_group` — daemon entry point that downloads a DM group by id, resolving creator identity from the group. Batch-path `download_messages` unchanged.
- `DownloadMessagesForGroup.sender_id` — optional field carrying the WS `senderId` so the runner can pre-populate creator identity.

### Changed

- **Dependency floor**: `stash-graphql-client` bumped from `>=0.11.0` to `>=0.12.0`, unlocking batched GraphQL mutations (`save_batch`, `execute_batch`, `save_all`), `__side_mutations__` mechanism, and ActiveRecord-style relationship DSL. **Transitively requires Stash server v0.30.0+** (appSchema 75+).
- README rewritten to cover the daemon, YAML config, and the fork's new canonical home at `Jakan-Kink/fansly-scraper`. Repo URLs and issue references throughout updated from `prof79/fansly-downloader-ng`.
- Loguru / Rich color schema split; built-in level colors updated for consistent palette across log streams and live display
- Emoji throughout standardized to `Emoji_Presentation=Yes` (width-2, no VS16 selector hacks required by any modern terminal)
- Stash ORM Migration Guide refreshed — Phase 4 (advanced features) is now **Ready to Start**, with the SGC v0.12 batch APIs identified as primary adoption targets

### Fixed

- Rich Live display corruption from stdout prints — stable frame rendering under concurrent logging
- Silent Rich handler errors on catch-all exceptions — now surfaced to the log instead of being swallowed
- Pydantic config validation errors now readable + tolerant of retired-field upgrades (legacy configs with dropped fields load without raising)
- Signal / bridge / logging race conditions on daemon teardown — errors no longer leak past the thread boundary
- WebSocket logger split so daemon and sync-path WS traffic don't interleave in the same log level
- Two WebSocket / tempfile bugs closed during retired-flag cleanup
- Daemon messages handler no longer emits `"Could not find a chat history with None"` — `_handle_messages_item` now resolves creator from `item.sender_id` and calls `download_messages_for_group`, so attachments on incoming DMs actually download.
- Daemon `_on_service_event` "not mapped" DEBUG log only fires for genuinely unknown `(svc, type)` tuples now, not handled-returned-None.

### Deprecated

- Classic prose-style `ReleaseNotes.md` is frozen at v0.13.0. New releases are authored in this file (`CHANGELOG.md`) going forward.

### Removed

- **Retired settings** (silently dropped from legacy configs — no runtime code branches on them):
    - `db_sync_commits`, `db_sync_seconds`, `db_sync_min_size` — SQLite-era `BackgroundSync` workaround, obsolete under PostgreSQL
    - `metadata_handling` — no-op since the Pydantic EntityStore rewrite
    - `separate_metadata` — SQLite-era flag
- `updater/` module (pycache-only remnant from the prof79-era self-updater, no tracked source)
- `config.sample.ini` — YAML migration makes the INI sample redundant
- Stale documentation pruned: pre-Pydantic test migration tracker, SA-ORM code examples from the Stash mapping reference, pre-work Stash integration analyses, rejected side-by-side PostgreSQL plan, abandoned async-conversion plan, archaic H.264/MP4 PDF + author notes (superseded by PyAV for mp4 hashing)
