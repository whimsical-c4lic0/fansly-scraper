# Changelog

<!-- markdownlint-configure-file { "MD024": { "siblings_only": true } } -->

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Prior history:** Releases before v0.13.0 are documented in [`ReleaseNotes.md`](https://github.com/Jakan-Kink/fansly-scraper/blob/main/ReleaseNotes.md) in the project's original prose-style format. The v0.13.0 entry is mirrored here in Keep-a-Changelog form and is the canonical structure for all subsequent releases.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.14.1] - 2026-05-13

Patch release for a render-policy regression in v0.14.0's nested `LoggingSection` schema.

### Fixed

- `_section_to_map` now applies the "set OR `_ALWAYS`" render rule at every nesting level, not just the top section. v0.14.0 inlined nested Pydantic submodels via `model_dump()` recursively, dumping every inner field including unset conditional ones as `None`; ruamel.yaml wrote each `None` as a bare `key:` line. Symptom: an enabled `trace` handler produced `format:` / `max_size:` / `rotation_when:` / etc. with no values, alongside the real `enabled`/`filename`/`level` lines. Fresh scaffolds are unaffected.

### Notes

If your v0.14.0 `config.yaml` already shows bare-key lines under any logging handler entry (`format:` with no value, `max_size:` with no value, etc.), delete them once by hand. Pydantic's loader treats an explicit `field: null` as "operator set this", so the next save preserves the bare keys rather than self-cleaning. The manual edit is a one-time fix.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-05-13

Verbosity refactor (`--debug` → `-v`/`-vv` with broader trace semantic), config-driven logging schema, daemon scope fixes (#94), and tag-triggered auto-release workflow.

### Added

- Config-driven `LoggingSection`: eight named loggers (two console + six file) under `logging:`, each with `enabled`/`level`/`format` plus orthogonal size and time rotation axes. Per-handler `None` falls through to `logging.global.default_*`. Pre-v0.14 flat shape (`logging: {sqlalchemy: INFO, textio: INFO, ...}`) auto-migrates to the nested form via a `model_validator(mode="before")`.
- `-v` / `-vv` CLI flags (`action="count"`). `-v` floors every handler at DEBUG; `-vv` floors every handler at TRACE and opens the `trace.log` sink. Per-run only; never written back to `config.yaml`.
- Daemon simulator state transitions now emit cause-tagged log lines: `daemon.runner: activity state -> active (new_content/<source>)` from the home-timeline + story polling loops, and `... -> active (ws_interrupt svc=N type=M)` on WS-bus wake from hidden state.
- `.github/workflows/release-on-tag.yml` — GitHub Action that creates a Release from the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section on `v<digit>...` tag push. PEP 440 (`v0.14.0`, `v0.14.0b1`, `v0.14.0.dev1`) + SemVer (`v0.14.0-rc1`) shapes both supported; alpha/beta/rc/dev flagged as pre-release, `.postN` stays stable.

### Changed

- Trace mode runtime semantic broadened. `-vv` and persistent `logging.global.trace=true` now floor **every** handler at TRACE, not just `trace_logger`/`sqlalchemy`/`websocket` as before. `setup_handlers` operates on a `LoggingSection.model_copy(deep=True)` so the runtime override doesn't leak back into `_config.logging` and silently persist into YAML on the next `_save_config`.
- `monitoring.livestream_recording_enabled` default flipped `true` → `false`. The feature was previously on by default without docs (#94).
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/report-a-bug.md` rebranded for the Jakan-Kink fork: links point to `Jakan-Kink/fansly-scraper`, version example bumped to v0.13.7, "config.ini options" reference replaced with `config.yaml` + `docs/configuration/config_options.md`.
- `docs/configuration/config_options.md` audited: CLI ↔ config mapping table rewritten (~30 real flags; the prior table listed `-dm`, `-p`, and `--metadata-only` entries that are no longer present in `argparse` — these were removed from the table). Retired-field callouts added under every affected section. `-r` / `--reverse-order` description corrected to "reverse alphabetical creator order" — the flag controls `sorted(user_names, ...)`, not timeline chronology.

### Fixed

- Daemon WS handlers now honor the `-u` scope filter on message and full-creator items, matching the behavior story polling already had. Foreign-creator events (a message from a creator outside the `-u` set, a WS subscription event for an unrelated account) are skipped instead of triggering scrapes (#94).
- `tests/api/unit/test_websocket.py::test_ping_timeout_resets_connection` setup ordering: `_last_ping_response = 0.0` now runs **after** `_start_ping_loop()`, so the production's loop-start reset doesn't clobber the stale-value setup. Fixes intermittent failure under `-n8`.

### Removed

- `--debug` CLI flag. Use `-v` (DEBUG floor on every handler) or `-vv` (TRACE floor on every handler) instead.
- Schema fields `options.debug`, `options.trace`, `logging.global.debug`. Legacy `config.yaml` files carrying any of these load cleanly — the retired-field validator (`_DROPPED_FIELDS`) strips them before `extra="forbid"` runs. Operators wanting persistent verbosity should edit `logging.global.default_level` (per-handler default) instead.

## [0.13.7] - 2026-05-12

WebSocket gateway refactor, livestream/daemon hardening, and production fixes surfaced by the tests-to-100 fixture migration.

### Added

- WebSocket event classification: known no-op events (e.g. service=1,2 post-like broadcasts) now identify concretely in trace logs instead of being labeled "unknown event".
- H.264 High-profile mux path for IVS livestream recordings; `daemon/livestream_watcher.py` split from the parent module.

### Changed

- WebSocket subsystem collapsed: subprocess `FanslyWebSocket` is the single production class — the threading variant and the separate gateway layer have been folded in.
- `cors_options_request` in `get_with_ngsw` / `get_with_ngsw_sync` is gated on `add_fansly_headers`. CDN downloads (which pass `add_fansly_headers=False`) no longer fire OPTIONS preflight — saves one round-trip per file and removes an anti-detection fingerprint real browsers don't produce on CORS-simple GETs.
- Gallery image linking switched to `Gallery.__side_mutations__["images"]` (SGC v0.12+) via direct `gallery.images = ...` assignment — one batched `addGalleryImages` per gallery save instead of N `imageUpdate(gallery_ids=...)` calls.
- WS ping/pong pairs removed from trace logs (2 events per 20s saturated slow-period logs).
- Daemon simulator no longer pins to the active state; home-feed limbo state fixed.
- `_resolve_variant_url` (livestream) made async; was previously blocking.

### Fixed

- Config schema validation issue.
- IVS muxing issues and logging-level mismatches in livestream recording.
- Stale `gallery_ids` re-submission via `imageUpdate` causing intermittent ~18% flake on stash gallery integration tests; the new gallery-side relationship path (see Changed) avoids re-submitting the image's full `gallery_ids` list and so the FK validation can't fail on cleaned-up gallery refs.

### Dependencies

- Pin `asyncpg<0.31` (downgrade 0.31.0 → 0.30.0). asyncpg 0.31.0 has a Cython teardown SIGSEGV regression on Python 3.13 under high-worker pytest configurations. Add asyncpg-stubs 0.30.2 for typing coverage.
- Poetry deps refresh.

## [0.13.6] - 2026-05-09

Livestream recorder overwrite-protection on broadcast reconnects.

### Added

- `_unique_output_path` helper in `daemon/livestream_watcher.py`: when a broadcast reconnect would produce the same output filename as a previously completed (or crash-interrupted) session, the new recording is written to `<stem>_part2.mp4`, `_part3.mp4`, etc. A slot is considered taken when the MP4 already exists with data **or** when its temp segment dir is still on disk from a prior crashed attempt.

### Fixed

- Livestream recorder silently overwrote the previous session's completed MP4 whenever a creator reconnected mid-broadcast. `_record_stream` now calls `_unique_output_path` before creating the temp segment dir, ensuring each reconnect session gets a distinct output file.

## [0.13.5] - 2026-05-09

Async API migration, YAML config render-policy, interactive prompt refactor, rate-limiter hardening, atomic downloads, URL centralization, livestream recording, and logging sink fix.

### Added

- `daemon/livestream_watcher.py` — long-running watcher task that polls `GET /api/v1/streaming/followingstreams/online` and spawns a per-creator recording task for every followed creator who is live.
- IVS HLS recording via manual segment polling (`httpx` + `m3u8`): dedup by `EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE` index, `EXT-X-PREFETCH` leading-edge hint collection, and a 60 s `EXT-X-ENDLIST` grace period for transient creator pauses.
- PID-based PyAV mux (`_mux_ivs_segments`): probes up to 5 segments to identify stable audio/video PIDs, PTS-rebases packets across segment boundaries, and writes a single MP4.
- Orphan-segment salvage (`_salvage_orphan_segments`): on watcher startup, re-muxes `.<stem>_segments` temp dirs left behind by a prior crash.
- Three new `MonitoringSection` config fields: `livestream_recording_enabled`, `livestream_poll_interval_seconds` (default 30), `livestream_manifest_poll_interval_seconds` (default 3, range 1–15).
- Six new Fansly API endpoints: `get_following_streams_online`, `get_streaming_channel`, `get_chatroom_messages`, `get_chatrooms`, `get_chatrooms_settings`, `post_chatroom_subalert`.
- `StreamSession`, `StreamChannel`, `StreamingInfo` Pydantic models in `metadata/models.py` for ephemeral livestream API payloads.
- `textio/prompts.py` — new module centralizing all interactive user prompts; all call sites migrated from inline `input()`/`ainput()` to the new helpers.
- `FanslyApi.BASE_URL`, `FANSLY_HOST`, `WS_URL` class variables and 16 endpoint `@property` templates centralizing every Fansly URL in one place.
- `--show-config` and `--generate-config` CLI flags.
- `config_schema` render-policy markers (`always` / `conditional`) so generated scaffold configs include only operator-required fields.
- `respect_timeline_stats` config field; nullable `usernames` field.
- `cascade-up` semantics for section serialization in the YAML loader.
- `tests/fixtures/config/config_fixtures.py`: `unit_config`, `unit_config_path`, `no_display`, `validation_config` fixtures (distinct from the DB-backed `config`).
- `tests/fixtures/download/story_factories.py`: `FakeStory` factory.
- Rate limiter: asyncio.gather concurrency tests covering `floor=0` and `floor>0` serialization invariants.

### Changed

- All `FanslyApi` HTTP methods migrated to `async`/`httpx.AsyncClient`; the entire download pipeline is now fully async end-to-end.
- `RateLimiterDisplay.start()` moved from `get_api()` to `setup_api()` so the cached constructor remains I/O-free.
- `textio/prompts.py` consolidates all prompts; `textio/textio.py` and call sites simplified accordingly.
- YAML loader refactored to preserve `model_fields_set` honesty and fix the `_rebuild_schema_from_config` round-trip (mutates sections in place instead of reconstructing them).
- `config/fanslyconfig.py` section-model decomposition aligned with new render-policy schema.
- Regular downloads stream into a sibling `NamedTemporaryFile` and atomically `shutil.move` to the target path — partial files no longer reach the dedup hash store on interrupted downloads.
- Unbound `logger.*` calls (no `.bind(logger=...)`) now route to the textio console and file handlers instead of being silently dropped by all filters.
- `api/websocket.py` `http_client` typed to accept `httpx.AsyncClient` in production and `httpx.Client` on the legacy test path.
- `daemon/filters.py` `should_process_creator` ported to async.

### Fixed

- Rate limiter Bug A residual: `_reserve_slot` cursor stalled at `learned_floor=0` on cold start. Now advances by `max(floor, token_refill_interval)` so concurrent waiters serialise even before the floor warms up.
- Rate limiter: removed redundant `last_backoff_time` double-write in the success-reduction branch that was staling the cursor clamp.
- Config INI loader: `model_fields_set` honesty preserved during migration so fields touched only by defaults are not written to the output YAML.
- `_rebuild_schema_from_config` round-trip: sections are now mutated in place rather than reconstructed wholesale, fixing field-ordering regressions.
- Logging grapheme-cluster collapse for supplementary-plane emoji and VS16-modified codepoints that misaligned Rich column widths over SSH/tmux.

## [0.13.4] - 2026-05-08

Stash integration enhancements for non-aligned library layouts and separate-host workflows, a streaming-response error-handling fix, and test-suite housekeeping that retires unused packaging dependencies.

### Added

- `stash_context.override_dldir_w_mapped` config field. When `true`, `get_stash_path()` returns `mapped_path` directly and ignores the per-creator subfolder structure — path filters scope to the entire fansly-managed area in Stash. Targets users who copy scraper downloads to a separate Stash host and reorganise the files into a different folder structure (e.g. split by media type into `Videos/<studio>/` and `Photos/<studio>/`), so the per-creator subfolder name the scraper expects (`<creator>_fansly/`) never appears in any Stash file path. Pydantic validator rejects the flag at config load when `mapped_path` is unset.
- `stash_context.require_stash_only_mode` config field. When `true`, Stash integration only engages on `--stash-only` runs; regular download modes (NORMAL, TIMELINE, MESSAGES, WALL, SINGLE, STORIES, COLLECTION) skip every Stash code path even when `stash_context` is populated. Workflow: scrape locally, copy files to the Stash host manually, then run `--stash-only` to attribute metadata.
- `FanslyConfig.stash_active` property — single decision point for "should Stash run this iteration." Replaces the bare `stash_context_conn is not None` check at the post-download StashProcessing call site.
- Three-tier anchor in `_create_targeted_regex_pattern`: per-creator `base_path` (default), `mapped_path` (when scoped=False with mapping set), or code-only (no mapping). The lazy per-batch fallback now scopes regex queries to `mapped_path.*(codes)` instead of going library-wide when mapping is configured.
- `prompt-toolkit` runtime dependency. The interactive download-directory prompt in `pathio` now offers tab-completion, `~`-expansion, and inline path validation.

### Changed

- `_section_to_map` (YAML save) now uses `model_dump(by_alias=True)` with an alias-to-attribute lookup so aliased fields write their YAML key on save instead of the Python attribute name. Previously `LoggingSection.json_level` was dumped as `json_level: ...` which the loader rejected on next start (`extra_forbidden`) — config files written by 0.13.3 would fail to reload.
- `LoggingSection` gained a `mode="before"` validator that remaps legacy `json_level:` keys to the canonical `json:` alias before the `extra="forbid"` rejection fires, so configs broken by the prior save bug keep loading.
- `get_stash_path()` resolution ladder: override + mapped_path → `str(mapped_path)`; mapped_path only → prefix substitution (existing 0.13.3 behaviour); neither → unchanged local path.
- Stash file indexers (`_index_scene_files` / `_index_image_files`) now use `fileio.normalize.get_id_from_filename` for media-ID and preview-ID extraction instead of hand-rolled `_id_` / `_preview_id_` parsing. Single regex pass; `is_preview` is now available as a side-channel signal for downstream tagging work.

### Fixed

- Every non-200 download response was raising `httpx.ResponseNotRead` instead of the intended `DownloadError`. `_download_file` and `_download_regular_file` request `stream=True` from `get_with_ngsw`, then on the non-200 branch tried to format an error with `response.content.decode('utf-8')` — httpx forbids reading `.content` on a streaming response without a prior `.read()`. Fixed to call `response.read().decode("utf-8", errors="replace")` first, so the actual server status and body now surface in error logs for failed downloads.
- `mapped_path` resolution edge case in the by-code regex fallback.

### Removed

- `pyinstaller` dev dependency. The packaging build was abandoned upstream and the dead-test audit flagged the harness code as untested-and-unreachable.
- `psutil` test dependency (typing stub `types-psutil` retained for type-checking).

## [0.13.3] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- `stash_context.mapped_path` config field: translates the local `download_directory` prefix to the path the Stash container sees, enabling the Stash integration for Docker / NFS setups where mount point prefixes differ between the scraper environment and the Stash server. Set to the Stash-side root (e.g. `/data/fansly`) and leave `download_directory` as the local path. All three Stash path operations (metadata scan, `path__contains` preload filter, and targeted regex fallback) now go through a new `get_stash_path()` helper in `pathio`.

### Removed

- `--stash-scheme`, `--stash-host`, `--stash-port`, `--stash-apikey` CLI flags. These were silently broken (the application code was accidentally placed inside a docstring in `check_attributes()` and never executed). Stash connection settings are config-file only; `--stash-only` (a mode flag, not a connection setting) is retained.

### Added

- WebSocket transport now runs on its own dedicated thread with a private asyncio loop (`FanslyWebSocket.start_in_thread()` / `stop_thread()`). Inbound service events are marshalled back to the main loop so handler- side state (EntityStore, StashClient, asyncpg pool) stays single- threaded.
- New `_handle_wallet_transaction` daemon handler observes Fansly `svc=6 type=3` wallet transaction events (subscription/PPV payments) and logs them at INFO so file-availability changes leave a trail.
- `_configure_warnings_capture()` wires `logging.captureWarnings(True)` and routes `py.warnings` records through loguru, so warnings emitted via `warnings.warn()` (notably `stash-graphql-client`'s `StashUnmappedFieldWarning`) now reach the rich console and every log-file sink instead of bypassing them to raw stderr.
- `InterceptHandler.emit` now routes by `record.name`: SQLAlchemy / asyncpg / Alembic records to the db sink, `stash_graphql_client.*` to the stash sink, and `py.warnings` records routed by origin file path.

### Changed

- **Eliminated WebSocket reconnect death-spiral.** The ping_worker previously shared the main asyncio loop with downloads, GraphQL processing, and polling; under load the loop drifted > 5s, the worker woke late and misdiagnosed its own scheduling lag as a Fansly server keepalive failure, tearing down a healthy connection roughly every 30 seconds. Moving the WebSocket transport to its own thread with a private loop fixes the root cause (the ping timeout itself is spec'd from Fansly's `main.js` as `1.2 * pingInterval` and cannot be loosened without diverging from protocol behavior).
- **CLI flags no longer silently rewrite `config.yaml`.** Every flagged field (`--stash-only`, `--normal`, `--messages`, `--timeline`, `--collection`, `--single`, `--debug`, `-uf` / `-ufp`, `-u`, the nine negative-bool flags, the three positive-bool flags) is now marked as an _ephemeral override_ and cannot leak into the on-disk YAML. In particular, `--debug` no longer clobbers `debug: true` in YAML on every invocation that omits the flag, and `-u creator1,creator2` no longer overwrites a curated `user_names` list with the daemon's auto-fetched following list.
- **Narrowed daemon over-eager following refresh.** `_worker_loop` now only triggers `_refresh_following` on `FullCreatorDownload` (confirmed subscription WS events), not on `DownloadTimelineOnly`. The `/timeline/home` poll's creators are already in the following set by construction, so the prior per-poll-hit refresh fanned out to ~30 account fetches per new post.
- YAML's `session_baseline` is now consume-and-reset: loaded once into the runtime field, then cleared and persisted as `null`. Self-heals YAMLs left in permanent-full-pass state by a prior schema-write bug.
- Hash-computation calls in `download/media.py` (post-download and mid-download checks, 4 sites) now run via `asyncio.to_thread` so they no longer block the main download loop.
- Bumped `stash-graphql-client` floor from `>=0.12.0` to `>=0.12.2`. `stash/processing/base.py` imports and catches `StashCapabilityError`, which only exists in SGC ≥ 0.12.2; the older floor allowed installs to resolve to a version missing that symbol.

### Performance

- **30-creator daemon pass: ~70 min → ~12 min (6× speedup); peak RSS: 9 GB → ~2.4 GB.** Cumulative effect of the entries below.
- FanslyObject `_snapshot` now uses `PrivateAttr(default=None)` with initialization in `model_post_init`, rather than `default_factory=dict`. Pydantic 2.13's `init_private_attributes` calls `inspect.signature` on every `default_factory` per instance to decide whether the factory takes a validated-data argument; for C-implemented built-ins (`dict`) that lookup falls into `inspect._signature_fromstr` (~50 KB allocation per call, not cached upstream). At identity-map preload scale (~682K FanslyObject constructions across all model types) this dominated per-instance cost. Mirrors `stash-graphql-client@c701c4606` (the upstream sibling fix that ships for SGC-side entities).
- 18 mutable list field defaults converted from `= []` to `Field(default_factory=list)`. Pydantic 2 deep-copies mutable field defaults per instance to prevent shared state; `Field(default_factory=list)` calls the factory directly without going through `copy.
deepcopy`. Eliminates ~106 MB of allocator churn (memo dicts, `_keep_alive` table, dispatch walks) per startup preload — confirmed by memray attribution dropping from 119 MB to 13 MB through the `copy.py` subtree.
- `PostgresEntityStore._type_index: dict[type, set[int]]` secondary index. Per-type iteration paths (`filter`, `find` cache-first, `find_one`, `count`, `find_iter`, `invalidate_type`, `cache_stats`) now run in O(this type) instead of O(`_cache`). Mirrors MMsD `postgres_entity_store.py:333` / SGC `store.py` `_type_index`. Maintained alongside `_cache` in `cache_instance` / `invalidate*`.
- Monotonic-clock TTL with per-type override: `PostgresEntityStore(default_ttl=...)` constructor argument and `store.set_ttl(model_type, ttl)` per-type setter. `_is_expired` uses `time.monotonic()` (immune to wall-clock changes). Daemon poll cadences span 30s (stories) to 10min (FYP), so per-type granularity matters; `get_from_cache` evicts and returns `None` once an entry's TTL has elapsed.
- `cache_stats()` rewritten to walk `_type_index` (O(types)) instead of scanning `_cache` (O(N)); now also exposes the existing `_stats` hit/miss counters in the same payload.
- Singular `belongs_to` relationships go tri-state — `UNSET` / `None` / object — using SGC's `UnsetType` sentinel imported from `stash_graphql_client.types.unset`. `__setattr__` distinguishes the three states; cache hits link the relationship, cache misses leave `UNSET` so consumers use `is_set()` to distinguish "not yet loaded" from "explicitly cleared". `_autolink_relationships(obj)` runs after `model_validate` to resolve `UNSET` → cached object after DB-load, preventing `to_db_dict`'s FK-derivation loop from clobbering FK columns to NULL.
- Stash creator-media indexes (`_scene_code_index`, `_image_code_index`) now store entity IDs rather than full Pydantic refs. Storing full objects pinned them past `invalidate_type`, so the per-creator heap drop was deferred to end-of-stash. `find_*_by_media_codes` rehydrates via `store.get_many` (cache-first, batched DB-fetch for misses).
- Per-creator stash invalidation list extended to include `VideoFile` and `ImageFile` leaves. `Scene`/`Image` preload via the GraphQL fragment caches the file-leaf children as separate identity-map entries; orphaning them across creators leaked ~3.9k objects per pass on a typical fan with ~3k images and ~800 scenes.

### Fixed

- **`StashUnmappedFieldWarning` and other `warnings.warn()` output now reach loguru sinks.** Two compound failures: `logger.patch()` was treated as in-place but actually returns a new logger (so `extra["logger"]` was never bound on stdlib-routed records, and every sink's `record.extra.logger == "<name>"` filter rejected them), and `logging.captureWarnings(True)` was never called (so `warnings.warn()` never entered the stdlib logging path at all). Together, SGC's `StashUnmappedFieldWarning` and any other library's `warnings.warn()` output bypassed the rich console + log files entirely.
- `InterceptHandler.emit` and `SQLAlchemyInterceptHandler.emit` previously fell back to `level = str(record.levelno)` on unknown level names; that string re-raised inside loguru's `.log()` because numeric strings are not registered level names. Pass the int through directly — loguru accepts ints natively.
- `config/logging.py`'s console formatter now escapes `<` in record messages in addition to `{`/`}`, so traceback frame names like `<module>`, `<listcomp>`, and `<genexpr>` no longer crash loguru's colorizer with `ValueError: Tag "<module>" does not correspond to any
known color directive`. Loguru re-parses callable formatter output to strip tags even when `colorize=False`, so the escape is required regardless of sink color setting.
- `stash/processing/base.py` now catches `StashCapabilityError` distinct from `StashVersionError`, so per-feature appSchema gate failures surface as a clean error message rather than the bare exception that was leaking out of `get_client()`. Also broadens an over-narrow `except RuntimeError` (line 346): `stash_graphql_client.metadata_scan` raises `ValueError` on transport errors, which previously escaped uncaught.
- `_shutdown_js_bridge` (`helpers/checkkey.py`) previously only called `connection.stop()`, which terminates the Node subprocess but leaves several JSPyBridge Python daemon threads (`com_thread`, `stdout_thread`, `EventLoop.callbackExecutor`, per-task threads) blocking on `stream.readline()` / `queue.get()` until each individually polls and notices the subprocess died. Now joins all of them explicitly.
- Three daemon worker-loop bugs surfaced and fixed during test reform: `_handle_full_creator_download` was calling `download_wall(config, state)` without the required `wall_id`, `_refresh_following` was missing `get_creator_account_info`, and `_handle_timeline_only_item` was passing an empty `creator_name=""` downstream.
- xdist worker shutdown no longer raises `SIGABRT` / `SIGSEGV` / `SIGBUS`. Root cause was daemon threads (Rich Live refresh, loguru handler workers, httpx connection pool teardown) racing against `_Py_Finalize.flush_std_files` mid-buffered-write. Fixed by setting `TESTING=1` before any project import (forces synchronous loguru sinks), enabling `faulthandler.enable(all_threads=True)` for future diagnostics, plus per-test cleanup discipline (autouse fixtures that reset Rich/loguru/httpx state after every test) and an `atexit` backstop in `helpers/rich_progress.py`.
- Stash GraphQL test responses aligned with SGC 0.12's numeric-string / UUID4 ID validator and the new `StashEntityStore.populate()` filter- query resolution hop that fires before mutations.

### Removed

- `FanslyWebSocket.start_background()` / `stop()` / `_background_task` — replaced by the thread-based lifecycle (`start_in_thread()` / `stop_thread()`). Migrated all in-tree callers (`api/fansly.py`, `daemon/runner.py`, `scripts/websocket_example.py`); no deprecation period.
- `--updated-to` CLI flag and the corresponding `FanslyConfig` field. The self-update feature was removed upstream and the field had zero readers.
- `tests/daemon/conftest.py` — only `tests/conftest.py` is permitted per the project rule. The three fixtures it housed (`fake_ws`, `saved_account`, `config_wired`) migrated to `tests/fixtures/`.

### Internal

- Test-suite reform: every internal mock removed in favor of real fixtures, factories, and `store.add()` / `store.save()` preloads. Edges remain mocked via `respx` (Fansly HTTP, Stash GraphQL via the `httpx` transport) and external-library leaf calls (`imagehash`, `hashlib`, ffmpeg subprocess). Total project coverage rose to ~97.5% with `config/logging.py` at 100%, `api/websocket.py` at 99.06%, and new daemon test modules covering bootstrap, runner handlers, and runner loops end-to-end.
- New `--dist=loadgroup` pytest configuration plus an `xdist_group(name)` marker. Tests pinned to the same group share an xdist worker so their fragile shared state (notably the `message_media_generator` fixture's find-or-create race against a shared Docker Stash) doesn't deadlock across workers.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-04-23

Patch release fixing two issues reported on Windows + Python 3.14, plus rolling up incidental `fork-main` commits since v0.13.0.

### Added

- `docs/reference/request-signing.md` — reverse-engineered notes on Fansly's request-signing scheme.

### Changed

- **Dependency**: added `filelock ^3.29.0` as a direct runtime dep, replacing POSIX-only `fcntl` usage in the `config.ini → config.yaml` migration lock (see #77). filelock picks the right platform primitive automatically (`fcntl.flock` on POSIX, `msvcrt.locking` on Windows).
- `poetry.lock` and pre-commit hook versions refreshed.

### Fixed

- **#77** — Unconditional `import fcntl` at `config/loader.py:28` crashed app startup on Windows (fcntl is POSIX-only). Swapped to [filelock](https://github.com/tox-dev/filelock) with identical non-blocking semantics. Bonus: filelock cleans up stale `config.ini.migrating.lock` files on release (safe — unlink happens while the lock is still held, no TOCTOU).
- **#78** — Fansly returns `locations=[{"location": null, "locationId": 1}]` for some media (Direct slots with no CDN path resolved yet), which the required-str typing on `MediaLocation.location` rejected with 8 Pydantic validation errors per affected `Media`. Relaxed the field to `str | None` and the DB column to NULL-tolerant (Alembic migration `bb7006ec7c0e_make_media_locations_location_nullable`). Downstream readers at `media/media.py:27` already handled `None` via the `loc.raw_url or loc.location` fallback.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-04-22

First release under the Keep-a-Changelog format. Flagship feature: the post-batch monitoring daemon. Also rolls up every notable change landed since v0.11.0 shipped (a "v0.12" line was never cut as a distinct release).

### Added

- **Post-batch monitoring daemon** (`--daemon` / `-d` / `--monitor`) — continuous WebSocket-driven event dispatch for new posts, stories, PPV messages, message edits/deletes, subscription changes, and profile updates. Decoded `ServiceEvent` dicts are translated into typed `WorkItem`s (`DownloadTimelineOnly`, `DownloadStoriesOnly`, `DownloadMessagesForGroup`, `FullCreatorDownload`, `CheckCreatorAccess`, `RedownloadCreatorMedia`)
- **`ActivitySimulator`** — three-tier state machine (active → idle → hidden) calibrated from real browser-session profiling drives the daemon's polling cadence
- Timeline + story polling fallback for when the WebSocket is quiet; timeline-first-page probe short-circuits inactive creators (`lastCheckedAt` vs `post.createdAt`)
- Persistent `MonitorState` table — daemon restarts don't re-trigger every story or cold-scan every timeline
- Live Rich dashboard with per-creator state, WS health, queued work, and simulator phase
- Single shared `FanslyWebSocket` instance for both batch-sync and the daemon loop, with bidirectional cookie sync
- Clean SIGINT drain — `Ctrl-C` stops the queue and tears down the WS connection without dropping in-flight work
- **YAML configuration** (`config.yaml`) — new primary config format; legacy `config.ini` files auto-migrate on first run and are backed up as `config.ini.bak.<timestamp>`. Comments in user-edited YAML are preserved across load → modify → save cycles via `ruamel.yaml`
- `config.sample.yaml` template
- New `[monitoring]` config section for activity-simulator phase durations and per-phase polling intervals
- **New documentation**:
  - [Architecture](reference/architecture.md) — canonical public architecture reference
  - [Monitoring Daemon Cadence](reference/monitoring-cadence.md) — polling intervals + anti-detection rationale
  - [Monitoring Daemon Architecture](planning/monitoring-daemon-architecture.md) — full daemon design document (intervals, endpoints, behaviors verified against production `main.js`)
  - [Fansly WebSocket Protocol](reference/Fansly-WebSocket-Protocol.md) — WS protocol breakdown: service IDs, message types, price encoding (mills ÷ 1000), dual endpoints
  - [Manual Token Extraction](guide/manual-token-extraction.md) — fallback browser-token extraction guide (salvaged from prof79 wiki)
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) — new Keep-a-Changelog format going forward
- MkDocs + readthedocs-themed docs site with GHA deploy workflow to `gh-pages`
- Daemon dispatch: explicit no-op handler pattern (`_handle_noop_events` + `_NOOP_DESCRIPTIONS` in `daemon/handlers.py`) distinguishes "known event, deliberately ignored" from "unknown event, coverage gap" in logs.
- `daemon.handlers.has_handler(svc, type)` helper exposed for callers that need to differentiate handled-returned-None from no-handler-registered.
- `download/messages.py::download_messages_for_group` — daemon entry point that downloads a DM group by id, resolving creator identity from the group. Batch-path `download_messages` unchanged.
- `DownloadMessagesForGroup.sender_id` — optional field carrying the WS `senderId` so the runner can pre-populate creator identity.

### Changed

- **Dependency floor**: `stash-graphql-client` bumped from `>=0.11.0` to `>=0.12.0`, unlocking batched GraphQL mutations (`save_batch`, `execute_batch`, `save_all`), `__side_mutations__` mechanism, and ActiveRecord-style relationship DSL. **Transitively requires Stash server v0.30.0+** (appSchema 75+).
- README rewritten to cover the daemon, YAML config, and the fork's new canonical home at `Jakan-Kink/fansly-scraper`. Repo URLs and issue references throughout updated from `prof79/fansly-downloader-ng`.
- Loguru / Rich color schema split; built-in level colors updated for consistent palette across log streams and live display
- Emoji throughout standardized to `Emoji_Presentation=Yes` (width-2, no VS16 selector hacks required by any modern terminal)
- Stash ORM Migration Guide refreshed — Phase 4 (advanced features) is now **Ready to Start**, with the SGC v0.12 batch APIs identified as primary adoption targets

### Fixed

- Rich Live display corruption from stdout prints — stable frame rendering under concurrent logging
- Silent Rich handler errors on catch-all exceptions — now surfaced to the log instead of being swallowed
- Pydantic config validation errors now readable + tolerant of retired-field upgrades (legacy configs with dropped fields load without raising)
- Signal / bridge / logging race conditions on daemon teardown — errors no longer leak past the thread boundary
- WebSocket logger split so daemon and sync-path WS traffic don't interleave in the same log level
- Two WebSocket / tempfile bugs closed during retired-flag cleanup
- Daemon messages handler no longer emits `"Could not find a chat history with None"` — `_handle_messages_item` now resolves creator from `item.sender_id` and calls `download_messages_for_group`, so attachments on incoming DMs actually download.
- Daemon `_on_service_event` "not mapped" DEBUG log only fires for genuinely unknown `(svc, type)` tuples now, not handled-returned-None.

### Deprecated

- Classic prose-style `ReleaseNotes.md` is frozen at v0.13.0. New releases are authored in this file (`CHANGELOG.md`) going forward.

### Removed

- **Retired settings** (silently dropped from legacy configs — no runtime code branches on them):
  - `db_sync_commits`, `db_sync_seconds`, `db_sync_min_size` — SQLite-era
    `BackgroundSync` workaround, obsolete under PostgreSQL
  - `metadata_handling` — no-op since the Pydantic EntityStore rewrite
  - `separate_metadata` — SQLite-era flag
- `updater/` module (pycache-only remnant from the prof79-era self-updater, no tracked source)
- `config.sample.ini` — YAML migration makes the INI sample redundant
- Stale documentation pruned: pre-Pydantic test migration tracker, SA-ORM code examples from the Stash mapping reference, pre-work Stash integration analyses, rejected side-by-side PostgreSQL plan, abandoned async-conversion plan, archaic H.264/MP4 PDF + author notes (superseded by PyAV for mp4 hashing)
